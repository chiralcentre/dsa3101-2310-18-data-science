ACCT414,Accounting Analytics Capstone,"Traditionally, the accounting function s role is always viewed as that of a steward, the control centre for the organisation, rather than the catalyst for enterprise growth. The term  back office  is often used to describe the operating nature of accounting function. So in today s volatile global business environment, the key challenge for accounting function is how to lead the enterprise in its growth strategies while ensuring effective risk management and stewardship of the enterprise.

With complexity and data proliferation, increasingly the CEO and the board turn to accountants to help make sense of all the data, to help cut through this complexity, and to provide more informed analysis on the business and its operation. The opportunity for accounting function is if it can generate the insights that help make better corporate decision making, while continuing to ensure effective control of the enterprise, its reputation as a catalyst for growth will be guaranteed. To do so, traditional accounting departments may have to transform themselves into  intelligent accounting functions .

Intelligent accounting functions run their operations as cost effectively as possible, leveraging technology to reduce finance operating costs; strengthen stewardship and control so as to establish a solid foundation to support growth. The biggest challenges, however, lie in creating the efficiencies needed to gather and process basic financial data and continue to deliver traditional finance outputs while at the same time redeploying their limited resources to enable higher-value business decision support activities.

This accounting analytics practicum which adopts SMU-X approach, focuses on a few key topics that are vital to establishing an intelligent accounting function (refer to the diagram below): finance strategy and transformation, lean finance and finance shared services, business intelligence analytics, and enterprise process management. In this experiential learning course, students from various disciplines learn what comprises a highly optimised accounting process, design an end-to-end process management and explore the underlying accounting IT systems and advanced data analytical applications. By working closely with instructors from accounting and information systems disciplines, together with an industry partner, students are expected to carry out design and development of an intelligent accounting function solution. The whole idea is to engage students in real-life application and to encourage students to creatively apply concepts to practical problems in their pursuit of solving real-world problems. Students will apply the concepts in real projects."

ACCT634,Risk Governance,"To create and sustain value, corporations today recognize the need for an active engagement in the setting of appropriate objectives with sound governance, risk management and assurance (GRA) frameworks and practices. This shift in paradigm is driven by increasing stakeholder demands and performance expectations as well as growing public scrutiny after some spectacular corporate failures around the globe.

While the board of directors holds statutory responsibility for effective governance, risk management and assurance, it is expected that appropriate GRA frameworks, policies and procedures are in place to ensure these accountabilities are working. In the context of sound board oversight, the Code of Corporate Governance (2012) prescribes that the CEO and CFO provide the board of directors with an annual assurance regarding the effectiveness of the company s risk management and internal control systems. This places the CFO with prime responsibility to over GRA frameworks and practices.

The purposes of this course are to provide participants with an overview of governance principles to achieve corporate objectives; the essentials of risk management to respond to threats affecting these objectives; and lastly, assurance principles and practices to assure the integrity of the governance and risk management frameworks.  GRA is more than merely a set  of policies, systems, processes and practices. Its fundamental thrust is to inculcate a culture of doing the right thing within the business and societal contexts.

This course adopts complementary strategic and stakeholders  perspectives of GRA. The stakeholder approach is designed to expose participants to the conflicting roles, influence, power and objectives of the parties that contribute to the corporation s  value creation process.

Participants will study the GRA framework to create and preserve corporate values (see below) and their importance in achieving corporate objectives.

Topics covered include corporate governance models (including code), risk management (e.g. ISO 31000, COSO) and relevant assurance frameworks as well as analytical tools for effective GRA practices.

Our goal is not only to review the existing research, but also to stimulate new work in the area and to help you develop your own research. We will do two things to achieve this goal. First, for each topic, we will discuss both seminal work and recently published studies or working papers that represent the recent development in the field. Second, we include some of our own papers. This inclusion not only reflects our research interests, but also enables us to discuss many important dimensions of conducting research that you do not see from the ultimate published version, such as how to generate research ideas and how to address concerns raised by reviewers.

Due to the sheer size of the literature, we are unable to cover many topics and omit many important papers. Some of the topics were covered in the previous seminars. Still you should not assume that this course together with other seminars can give you adequate coverage of financial accounting research. Our objective is to get you hooked on this stuff, and leave the rest to you."

ACM002,Arts Leadership,"As societies and nations begin to recognize the real value of the arts and as millions of dollars begin to be poured into the healthy life of the arts, serious questions about  leadership  begin to arise. Who leads when it comes to the arts? Why? How? Can a person lead in the arts without being an artist? Are there ideal leaders in this arena? To what extent are arts leaders motivated by considerations which go beyond the  bottom-line ? Why do authorities take a particular and sometimes a very specific interest in arts leaders? Is there an internationally-accepted template for arts leaders? What are the basic considerations which obtain when a leader in the arts is sought for? These and several other related issues will be explored in this module. Arts leaders will be brought to engage with the students and offer  real-life  examples of arts leadership."

By probing key phases and artists that embody radical shifts in the evolution of dance fresh perspectives and new insights into the context of dance in relation to society are revealed."
ACM207,The Art World: A Context for Framing Arts and Culture Management,"This course is intended as a contextual approach to arts and culture management. Key literature in arts and culture management (Chong, BrinAREAdle, DeVereaux, Hesmondhalgh) is conflated first with the communication, programming and responses to key visual arts events in Singapore (National Gallery, Art Stage, Singapore Art Week) to consider the multiple constituents of the art world   art practices, exhibitions, media, discourse, art market.  The reading of the visual arts scene is further considered against the theories of  art world  (Bourdieu, Danto, Dickie) so as to characterise how the art historical and critical discourse intersect with actual events, experiences and responses.  In delineating the above  context , theories and practices of arts and culture management are in turn read in relation to the  art world  both physical and conceptual."
ACM208,Art in Southeast Asia,"The Thukhuma Collection at the School of Social Sciences is a point of entry into this course on art in Southeast Asia from the mid-19th century to the present. Art works, artists and art developments in each of the Southeast Asian countries are considered along broader regional themes and actual contacts and networks (such as the triangulation of Manila, Xiamen and Singapore). Singapore s national collection of Southeast Asian art (at the National Gallery and Singapore Art Museum) forms the basis of images and resources for the course and participants are encouraged to view and interact with the works on display at the museums.

In particular, students will be exposed to a rich diversity of perspectives on the empirical challenges and operational issues faced by the literary arts value chain, including concepts of authorship, editorial, production, distribution, criticism and reception. Through experiential learning, students will also develop and enhance their understandings of the roles, functions and values of the collaborations, relationships and transmedia practices involved in the work of the arts manager.

Ultimately, this Level Two module is aimed at enabling the Arts and Culture Management major student in cultivating the critical knowledge and interpretative skillsets required to support and sustain the growth of reading, writing and publishing in Singapore today."
ACM210,Arts and Audiences,"This course provides students with a critical understanding of the themes, processes and techniques associated with developing, engaging and retaining audiences in the arts. Students will explore the diversity of forms, strategies and practices used to build and retain audiences for arts activities, including programming and content analysis, methodological research into audience attitudes, trends and expectations, and evaluating the suitability of a range of marketing and outreach techniques for varied contexts, content, forms and platforms. Through real-world case studies and experiential learning, students will tackle questions such as: Is there a difference between an audience, spectator, public, fan and community? What are the cultural, social and economic trends that impact attendance at arts events? How do arts managers attract new audiences to a deeper and richer range of arts programming and content? What is the difference between audience development, public participation and community engagement? How can arts managers best utilise existing resources to engage audiences from diverse backgrounds? What strategies are helpful for cultivating long-term arts audiences?

Ultimately, this course aims to provide students with a reflexive understanding of the challenges and opportunities involved in identifying, developing and retaining audiences for arts activities, as well as offering them critical skills to cultivate and engage with long-term arts audiences."
ACM211,The Art of Participation,"With the rise of the  immersive ,  interactive  and  participatory  in art, there has been an increased demand for the audience to perform as co-creator, as instigator, as player. The partitioning of roles that has conventionally cast the audience/spectator as being politically and aesthetically passive no longer holds. In this course, we will investigate the politics of participation in the arts, tracing the strategies of participation from the early iteration of forum theatre in Singapore to the gamification of performance. Examples would be drawn from across the eclectic genres of art: from environmental theatre to escape rooms, from exhibition design to theme parks, from pedagogy to perambulatory performances. Through the course, students will harness their critical position as participant-researchers, evaluating the commodification of audience experience even as they chart out new formations of collectivities within the experience economy. Reflexively, students will be expected to experiment with modes of participation in this module."
ACM212,Arts and Cultural Marketing,"Can marketing really make a difference? Do arts organisations and events sell more tickets or improve their  liking  because of marketing? What is the best strategy for arts and cultural organisations: traditional print, social media or a blend of both?

This course explores the essential and integrated role of marketing for non-profit and NGO-type organisations, particularly in the arts and cultural sectors. This course will identify relevant marketing methods, concepts and techniques to analyse successful (and failed) strategies, as well as to better understand the particular challenges faced by arts and cultural organisations. In particular, this course will focus on the study of integrated marketing communications (IMC).

Ultimately, this course examines how marketing can possibly play a vital role in the development of the arts and cultural sectors at local, regional and global levels."
ACM213,Cultural Relations and Diplomacy in Asia,"Historically, culture has been pivotal in building connections and consolidating associations between peoples, regions, and nation-states, across the globe. Whether  in  the  form  of  informal  and  organic relations  (e.g. J-pop and K-pop  cultures),  or  as  part  of  carefully  devised  diplomatic  strategies (e.g. China s   going  out   policy), culture  has  often  played active  roles in  our  societies  and  influenced political, social, and economic processes. This course will introduce students to the notion of culture as an integral component of international relations, and will explore the relevant concepts and practices ascribed to it. In particular, it will focus on understanding the importance of culture to contemporary governance and socio-political relations, principally within the context of Asia. This will be established through the exploration of the distinctive role played by culture during crucial historical moments, such as World War II, the Cold War, the post-Asian Financial Crisis, and our contemporary digitally interconnected societies.  Emphasis will be placed on the associations of culture with concepts such as soft power, development aid, and identity-building, among others."
ACM214,"Arts, Culture Industries and Everyday Life","In today s accelerated and uncertain climate of cultural complexity, digital networks and globalisation, the forms, behaviour and management of culture are mutating. This module introduces students to the significance of the arts and culture in the world of the everyday by exploring the rapidly-evolving relationships between various cultural forms, institutional sites and the practices of everyday life. Through the analysis of a range of culture industries   from screen media to music and fashion   this module will provide a nuanced understanding of how culture industries work, why they work as they do, the meanings they offer to consumers and participants, and the broader conceptual and practical implications of their management structures and functions. Ultimately, it will enable students to interrogate the naturalised meanings and rich textures of the arts, culture and creativity in their everyday lives, in relation to questions of cultural production, distribution and consumption."
ACM301,Cultural Policy and Practice,"What is the relationship between the state, arts and society? What is the role of cultural policy, particularly for the arts and cultural industries in Singapore? How does cultural policy translate into, and impact practice? Are there differences between forms of cultural policy in terms of how they function, and what they are intended to do?

This course provides students with a critical understanding of the significance and impact of cultural policy on arts management, practice and consumption. Through the exploration of a range of contemporary cultural policy issues and themes, students will critically consider the origins, functions and limitations of cultural policy, particularly in the Singapore context. Students will also interact with cultural policy-makers, arts managers and related stakeholders to obtain a working grasp of the mechanics and practicalities of cultural policies, and how policy impacts artists and arts practice.

Ultimately, this course aims to provide students with the ability and self-confidence to evaluate cultural policy in varying contexts, and to analyse and critique new policy initiatives for the arts and cultural industries as they arise."
ACM304,Exhibitions and Curating,"The course covers both theoretical and practical aspects of art exhibition making, primarily through discourses in curating and museum exhibition respectively. It is conducted in conjunction with the actual implementation of an exhibition project. The students will participate in the final stages of the exhibition project, including artwork movement, installation, publicity, official opening, and public programmes. The exhibition in turn serves as a case study for the course to examine critical issues and components of an exhibition, from research, design, programming to audience engagement, and in the context of the scholarship on Singapore art history and curatorial studies."
ACM305,"Arts, Partnerships and Publics","The arts is not a solo endeavour or isolated activity. Rather, the arts is firmly embedded in our everyday lives. In our increasingly complex and diverse society, the arts has become a powerful resource capable of bringing people together across boundaries and building stronger connections. Additionally, the art world has become a horizontal global matrix consisting of multiple constellations and routes, where art is practiced, produced, circulated and experienced in a complex ecology of artists, spaces, intermediaries, communities, activities and networks. Attendant with these developments is a diversification and dispersal in the ways in which arts, community and engagement intersect.

This course will provide students with an understanding of the role, significance and impact of partnerships and publics to the arts, especially in the context of Singapore. Through real-world case studies and experiential learning, this course will investigate the diversity of forms, practices, and strategies used to engage meaningful relationships with partners and publics. The course will also explore how the arts relate to changing landscapes and configurations of communities, ranging from the neighbourhood to the nation-state, and from groups defined in ethnic and racial terms to social classes. 

Ultimately, this course aims to provide students with a reflexive understanding of the significance of developing and maintaining meaningful partnerships and publics to the cultural competency, equity and sustainability of the arts, as well as foster a heightened understanding of the ties between the arts, self, society and culture."
ACM306,"Arts, Culture and the Global City","Across the globe, the arts and culture have been identified as key instruments for urban rejuvenation and global competitiveness. Asia is no exception   over the last twenty years, there has been a proliferation of large-scale arts and cultural infrastructure, as well as an energetic bubbling of artist-led initiatives in cities such as Singapore, Jakarta, Hong Kong and Seoul. 

This course aims to explore the growing and diversified roles of  arts  and  culture  in contemporary urbanism, and to interrogate how categories such as  arts  and  culture  can transform cities. In particular, this course will focus on the changing spatial conditions and challenges of the arts and culture in Asia, with a focus on the role of Singapore in the region during this time of rapid change, global complexity and increasing austerity.

Through an analysis of a range of real-world case studies and experiential learning, students will critically consider questions such as: What are the roles of arts and culture in cities today? Can the arts and culture become key drivers of urban growth, enabling cities to forge and maintain global connections? Do they differentiate cities, and generate distinctive place-identities amidst a globalising world? How do art events and exhibitions like biennales influence cultural and city development, and give rise to more diverse, reflective and vibrant societies? Can the arts and culture create, reinforce and enhance sense of place and belonging in global cities, especially for the less privileged? What are some of the particularities and specificities of the arts within cities in the Asia-Pacific region?

COMM330,Persuasion: The Business of Influence,"The single most challenging communication task in corporate and public life is persuasion, influencing others to understand, accept, and act on an often divergent viewpoint.  COMM330, Persuasion: The Business of Influence introduces you to the essentials of such effective influence.

This course asks some key questions about a complex and fascinating process: What makes some people so influential? What appeals to listeners: logic or emotion? How can I tell when someone is trying to deceive me? Why are some people especially susceptible to persuasive attempts?  How do mass influence conditions, like public policy campaigns, differ from how one gains compliance from individuals?

By discovering what is known in the last 50 years of research about persuasion, students will engage in applying persuasion concepts and strategies to creating more thoughtful and ethical persuasive messages and the right contextual conditions to promoting more effective persuasion.

COMM230,The Art of Pitching: Conveying Your Ideas Persuasively and Engagingly,"Steve Jobs, a master at pitching, once said,  The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.  Successful pitching, whether to investors, superiors, or other decision makers, involves a healthy mix of  crazy belief , confidence and risk-taking. For this reason, pitching can be both incredibly terrifying and exhilarating at the same time.

Understanding the fundamentals as well as the mechanics of pitching will take you far towards successfully pitching your ideas. And there s nothing like good, old-fashioned practice with plenty of feedback from peers and experts to help you hone your pitching skills. In this course, we will explore the fundamentals and mechanics of effective pitches and put into practice everything we are learning week by week towards becoming successful pitchers.

While many people think of pitching as only useful for those who need to raise money (for example, a start-up pitch), pitching is actually an essential skill for reaching agreement on almost any subject. Agreement can yield many outcomes: management buy-in for developing a product or service, closing a sale, securing a partnership, recruiting an employee, securing an investment, and even securing employment for yourself.

Nancy Duarte, a communication specialist, put it this way:  Companies are started, products are launched, climate systems are saved   possibly based on the quality of presentations. Likewise, ideas, endeavours, and even careers can be cut short due to ineffective communication.  In this course, you will be given a good foundation for successful pitching so that no worthy idea or endeavour of yours will fall short simply because it wasn t effectively conveyed."
COMM245,Internal Communication,"To achieve anything substantial at work, it is essential, if not necessary to amass support from internal stakeholders   to communicate and persuade colleagues to understand, accept and support ideas. Yet, most communication efforts in organisations tend to be directed externally. Internal communication is often misunderstood and is generally assumed as unnecessary as employees are expected to accept and comply. Recognising the importance of internal communication begins with the acknowledgement that organisations comprise sentient, thinking and diverse individuals who might not be readily agreeable and invariably obliging. Internal communication is fundamental as it can enable organisations to align missions and goals, cultivate common beliefs, coordinate activities, develop a shared identity and facilitate decision-making. Through project work with an external partner organisation and a variety of experiential in-class activities, this SMU-X course invites students to synthesise theories, frameworks and best practices from industry to address real-life business challenges affected by internal communication."
COMM246,Crisis Management and Communication,"Organizations are battling crises of some form or other every day. This can be internal crises like organizational miscommunication, personality clashes; or external crises, for instance, arising from policy mismanagement to terrorism. Due to the vulnerability of the organization to both internal and external uncertainties, no organization is immune from crises. Even as we speak, many organizations are managing the Covid-19 crisis that has engulfed the world.

This course equips students with the necessary skills and abilities to prepare for organizational crises, diagnose the nature of the crises, how to communicate during crises, and how to recover and learn from crises.

It is a useful course for those who wish to be equipped with knowledge for their work in public relations, human resource, finance, consultancy, management, law, and public administration; or any other areas."
COMM247,Managing Employee Communication,"Managing employee communication is a must-learn skill in today s constantly changing work environment that is highly matrixed, virtual, and across borders and cultures. When leaders master this critical skill, they are able to unlock the secrets of employee engagement. Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric and business consultant, even lists employee engagement as the number one measure of a company s health.

In this hands-on and practical course, you will be taught frameworks for enhancing employee communication. This course explores the power of engaging employees, and the tools and tactics required to create an inspired and connected employee community for driving a successful organizational strategy. You will comprehend how to establish a clear line-of-sight between employee contributions and organizational success. You will also learn how to create trust and build personal connections, discover the elements of successful leadership, and be exposed to frameworks that will provide guidance as to how to develop an impactful and results-driven communication strategy, and gain exposure to practical examples as well as learn from cases.

As you go through this process of learning, you will understand what it means to be an engaged employee. You will learn how to use participatory, collaborative and strategic tools to influence management approaches to employee communication. Before you become a leader, and even when you are a leader, you are first and foremost an employee. Since communication is a two-way process, both the leader and the employee need to comprehend the rules of engagement   this is what the course will impart   a toolkit for effective employee communication in today s project-centered, matrixed, or virtual organizations.

To hone your learning, you will be asked to practice what you learn by participating in a capstone project in which you will develop an employee communication plan for an assigned company."
COMM250,Change Communication: A Leadership Instrument for Transforming Organisations,"If management is like slaying monsters, change management compares to fighting monstrous hordes. Firstly,  because the specific change situation is often unique and therefore outside management s comfort zone. Secondly, because change can only be successful if all stakeholders (investors, employees, media etc.) support the process. Change operations fail often enough and become crises. Therefore true change leaders are also true communicators (or get their advice)   involving and persuading multiple and often conflicting stakeholder groups. Since change has become commonplace in business, change communication is today a pivotal function of leadership.

This case-based course aims to prepare students for the handling of communications during the most regular change processes: mergers & acquisitions; restructuring & divestments; turn-around programmes; corporate scandals (actual or perceived)."
COMM252,Communication Theory,"As an introductory theory course for undergraduate students, this course is designed to help students gain a comprehensive understanding of significant communication theories and their value in identifying and managing problems emerging in today s business communication.

Last but not least, they will have the opportunity to apply what they have learnt to a real-time, real-world client project."
COMM254,Overseas Project Experience (Corporate Culture and Values in Asia),"The course focuses on organizations that have empowered the local communities via the various community development and social transformation programmes that they have initiated. It provides a platform for students to learn about the thought leadership of these organizations and also creates opportunities for students to examine the relationship between success and good corporate culture. Do these organizations rely on one or two individuals or do the staff function as a team, regardless of rank? Is being competitive and aggressive prized over nurturance and social support? Is the chain of command lauded or is less hierarchy appreciated? Features of culture such as individualism/collectivism, power distance, masculinity/femininity, uncertainty avoidance, and issues related to episodes and relationships in intercultural communication will be discussed."
COMM255,User Experience and Digital Product Design,"This course provides an introduction to user experience (UX) practices, theories, and real-world approaches that can help you prepare for work at some of the most innovative technology companies of today that obsess over their users  needs, feedback, and satisfaction. With focus on communicating human-centered design across stakeholders in digital technology product organizations, you can learn how to create user experiences that enhance and augment the ways people work, communicate, and interact. Through a series of lectures, hands-on tutorials, and project-based assignments, you will acquire skills in all four basic activities of interaction design: discovery, design, prototyping, and evaluation. You and your project group will design an interactive digital app prototype based on the research findings of real human needs."
COMM256,Design Thinking and Communication,"Design Thinking is an open-ended, open-minded, and iterative approach to finding solutions for difficult business problems. It uses technology and a designer s toolkit, while focusing on human needs. You don t need to be a designer to become a design thinker. This course is your opportunity to learn to apply creative and collaborative tools, such as brainstorming and prototypes, to real-life challenges with a particular focus on how to communicate (i.e., pitch) innovative solutions. As we will discuss design thinking case studies at many Fortune 500 companies, you will be first introduced (in the form of interactive lectures) then practice (through hands-on workshops) the design thinking process. Designs go through many iterations and you will also refine your project multiple times. The course culminates in a group project pitch in front of external judges, who are ready to mentor (and sometimes even invest in) students to turn their entrepreneurial ideas into the next unicorn start-up."
COMM301,Machine Learning for Communication Management,"The course is designed to give students in the Communication Management major (Data, Design, Communication Track) and who are new to data analytics an understanding of how to carry out data-driven and data-informed managerial decision-making in business. The course will provide step-by-step guidance on how to execute machine learning methods using computational programming in R and deploy the analytic results in an interactive dashboard, using Shiny.

Students will be able to understand the processes and results of predictive analytics based on supervised (regression and classification) and unsupervised (clustering and dimensionality reduction) machine learning. This will be done in the context of solving business questions (e.g., predicting customer attrition and customer segmentation). This course will provide useful skills in computational data analytics for aspiring strategic thinkers in organizations.

As there will be discussions of cutting-edge science and technology used in business analytics, the course will be both conceptual and technical (experiential). The experiential (hands-on) learning portion is the critical component the course will employ hands-on (learning by doing) approaches. To fully understand what can be done and should be done, so that students can use what they learn during the course in their workplaces (or at least envision what could be done, and what questions to ask their organizations  data analytics teams), it is vital to undertake hands-on programming for predictive analytics."
COMM302,Designing Communication for Behavioural Change,"What makes people notice certain messages (commercials or news) and not others? How can a campaign for cognitive, affective, and behavioral changes be catchy, convincing, and contagious? When addressing such questions in organizational settings, communications managers often rely on what they know from executive experience and/or conventional wisdom, executing a number of communication strategies aiming at having a desired impact. This course will show how strategies that may hold intuitive appeal can be challenged and better informed by psychological principles underlying human judgment and decision-making. Students will learn the key psychological principles about how people process information in a given context and how to assess the conditions under which intended and/or unintended consequences arise. The learning, in turn, can be transformed to exert a competitive edge by identifying contributing and constraining factors of strategic communication to make an impact."
COMM320,Business Narratives for Asian Organizations,"Narratives can help organizations and brands to connect effectively with their audiences as well as to change beliefs, attitudes and behaviors. Drawing from diverse fields such as cognitive science and narrative psychology, this course will equip students with the concepts, frameworks and skills to craft effective narratives for organizations and brands in Asia. In addition, they will learn how to harness generative AI and apply what they have learnt in the course to a real-world overseas client project."

COMM334,Strategic Communication in Asia,"COMM334 is an advanced elective module designed for graduating students majoring in corporate communication. With Asia s economic ascendancy and modernisation, corporate communication in Asia has taken on a new importance in the past two decades. Home to over half of the world s population, unprecedented political, social and technological forces in an age of discontinuities are creating a new world order for Asia. The importance of communicating strategically and the need for greater cross-cultural understanding have never been more critical for organisations struggling to effectively communicate with diverse stakeholder groups across different geographies in this new multi-polar business environment. This course aims to equip graduating communication students with the ability to apply theory and understand how strategic communication has evolved to influence the integration of paid, earned, shared and owned media which are vital to unearthing unique characteristics that drive communication practice in selected developed and developing nations in Asia.

COMM351,Communicating Risk in Organisations,"Risk is an undeniable aspect of the business environment and while it is not possible to eliminate risk, what organisations can do is seek to identify and manage existing and emerging risks within acceptable risk tolerances. Risks need to be managed through consensus and communication so as to adequately allocate resources so as to mitigate these risks. This course examines research, theory and practice about hazards and risks. It looks at risk communication from multiple perspectives, including psychological, social, and cultural and in various fields such as corporate management, disaster management, public health and the environment. It uses case studies to illustrate theories of risk perception and risk communication and effects of various risk communication strategies, including public involvement techniques. A cross-cutting theme is that theory and practice often intersect in shaping our understanding of how people perceive, react to, and communicate about risk."

COMM671,Strategic Persuasive Communication for Organisational Success,"Success at work, and indeed, in life, often begins with persuasion. Persuasion is a central function of communication; we communicate to affect others; to change hearts and minds.
An individual s ability to persuade can contribute to individual success; at job interviews, proposal presentations, sales pitches, etc. An organisation s ability to be persuade, however, requires more than the sum of individual skills. In organisational contexts, effective and strategic persuasion requires an appreciation of how various factors might interact; including culture, leadership and ethics. This is particularly key in an age of information overload, fake news and digital distractions. Organisations that are able to adapt persuasion strategies will stand higher chances of success.
In addressing how strategic persuasive communication can drive organisational success, this SMU-XO course will examine key factors of persuasive communication in business and society. Drawing on communication theories and practices, students will learn to identify business challenges and to apply strategies for attitudinal, behavioural and organisational change in a real-world business case.

COMM674,Crisis Leadership,"Covid-19 has taken the world by storm. Governments are trying their best to manage the evolving crisis; leaders have to step up to communicate and lead. Indeed, organizations (operationalized as governments, corporate, not-for-profit, or even prominent individuals) are, literally, experiencing and battling crises of some form or other. This can be internal crises like miscommunication, personality clashes; to external crises like Covid-19, policy mismanagement, or terrorism. Due to the vulnerability of the organization to both internal and external uncertainties, no organization is immune from crises.

While organizations recognize the probability of the occurrence of crises, studies have shown that many do not have any preparation or plan to deal with them. Some do not find it necessary to take preventive measures; others simply do not know where to begin, and what to do.

This course aims to equip leaders like you with the necessary skills and abilities to prepare for organizational crises, diagnose the nature of the crises, communicate during crises, and learn how to lead. The emphasis, thus, is on the preventive, rather than reactive, aspects of crisis management.

Scholars agree that crisis management is a dynamic, ongoing process, through a life cycle. You will be taken through each step of the life cycle of a crisis, with the aim of helping you learn what you need to do at each phase. While many scholars have posited different frameworks, for this course, Wilcox, Cameron and Reber s (2015) proactive-strategic-reactive-recovery framework is adopted because of its emphasis on the preventive aspects."

Central to the course is the action-based and experiential Group Project Assignment that offers an opportunity for students to work in groups to collaborate with a non-profit organization or profit-based organization that upholds community development and/or corporate social responsibility or sustainability initiatives1, that is, they initiate and act as idea champions to contribute to community with a project of their own and approach beneficiaries along the way to amend or improve on their ideas. Students are also free to work with any profit and/or non-profit organization on an existing or new project they may have, provided such opportunities exist and are offered to students. 

As idea champions, students work in groups, to develop/invent a prototype/model or mobile application or put into place a process, program or plan such as a business plan that will value-add and contribute to the needs of the beneficiary or organization of their choice. It is entirely up to the leadership of the organization concerned whether they would consider implementing or not implementing what students have designed. In other words, there is no compulsion for any organization to eventually sponsor the proposed ideas to the organization(s) concerned or may be collaborating with.

The outcomes of the group project for students are outlined as follows:
(i) Students will learn about leadership from the leaders they are connecting with. For example, they will learn how and why today s leaders are engaged in community-based or social initiatives in Singapore and beyond.
(ii) Students will also learn from the leaders lessons on leadership and/or teamwork based on the leaders  experiences.
(iii) By undertaking a hands-on group project, students will also learn practical lessons as well as the complexities of teamwork based on their OWN experience and process of working internally, with their group mates and externally, with organizations outside of school.
(iv) Each student will also reflect on his/her own learning throughout the project from start to end as outlined below (see  Reflection Essay  for details).
(v) Students will also fulfill other learning objectives that include cognitive and academic development as outlined below in the section,  Learning Objectives "
COR1305,Spreadsheet Modeling and Analytics,"In this course, students acquire practical skills (bridging technology and real-world situations) in modeling and resolving business problems using personal computers. With computers becoming essential tools for executives in most organisations, knowing how to effectively use them to solve problems will be very helpful in other business courses and the student's future professional career.

Objectives
Upon completing the course, students will
  Know how to frame problems, and integrate various analytical skills (e.g. statistics and mathematics) to model and address management concerns.
  Be comfortable with the personal computer, motivated to self-learn problem analysis computer tools and know where to get relevant information and system resources.
  Be familiar with a variety of software solutions (e.g. add-ins) and gain competency in using a spreadsheet application as an analysis, model verification, simulation and management reporting tool."
COR1306,Capital Markets in China,"Since the establishment of two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen in early 1990s, China s capital markets have experienced amazing growth and become one of the largest capital markets in the world. The equity market is the dominant capital market and has been evolving and growing towards a more even mix of investor classes, with institutions such as investment funds, pension funds, insurance companies, corporates, sovereign wealth funds and Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFIIs) playing a more prominent role. The bond and derivatives markets are emerging as well and there is huge growth potential in the near future.

This course is designed to offer a detailed analysis of China's capital markets, ranging from the overall assessment of the macro-economic environment and political context, to the detailed micro level study of the specific players, instruments, and individual transactions. Through seminars, cases, discussions, and group projects, students explore the opportunities and challenges presented by the quickly evolving capital markets in China."
COR1307,Accounting for Entrepreneurs,"This course is designed to provide a broad base coverage of financial accounting, management accounting and taxation topics that are relevant to (future) business owners and entrepreneurs. Business owners and entrepreneurs need the general foundation to help plan and control business operations and finance as well as discussing and negotiating with other stakeholders of the business. This course is suitable for students who do not have prior knowledge in accounting and business. Therefore, this course may also act as a stimulator for students to pursue more advance courses in accounting and finance related topics available in SMU."
COR1701,Critical Thinking in the Real World,"You give reasons for what you do and think every day. You argue. You often argue about things that matter to you. For example you might argue that you are the best candidate for promotion, about whether your company should invest in China, about the best way to help a friend or about what the right thing to do is in an ethical dilemma. The list is up to you. Increasingly in the 21st job market, you will need to think straight about any issue, even those unfamiliar to you. Recent surveys indicate that the most important skills employers are looking for are critical thinking and problem solving skills. We will teach you how to get better at reasoning and arguing in a way that can be applied to any subject matter.

Topics covered include evaluating arguments, constructing arguments, reconstructing arguments, formalizing arguments, clarifying meaning and identifying common mistakes in argument (fallacies). At the end of the course you should be able to (1) identify the structures of real-life arguments in order to decide if they are good or bad, and (2) argue logically about things that matter to you. This course is specifically designed to improve writing, thinking and oral presentation skills that are applicable to all areas of academic study and relevant to working life. Careful application in this course will deepen your capacity to critically evaluate everyday practical scenarios and will help you  think outside the box ."
COR1703,"Managing in a Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous Context","The dynamic and fast changing nature of our world today is best described by VUCA, a term coined by the US Army War College. VUCA stands for Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous.  The Arab Spring saw a change of government in countries like Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen. Once powerful countries in Europe are now fighting bankruptcy. The growth of the developing world which was taken for granted has begun to slow down. Even companies that were synonymous with their product categories just a few years ago are now no longer in existence.  Kodak, the inventor of the digital camera had to wind up its operations, Borders, once the second largest US bookstore, has shut down due to their inability to evolve their business models with the changing times.

With such momentous changes happening in the world today, this course prepares the students to better understand the complexity and difficulties in reacting to the ambiguity inherent in those changes. This course helps students to understand the tensions in a given situation and how they need to think through a problem from multiple dimensions.

The course aims to give students an insight into the mega trends and forces that are impacting their world. We ask what are some of the causes of these trends and their business implications? What can future managers like themselves do about understanding these changing trends, and why they need to address, appreciate, adapt and attempt to manage these changes in their ecosystem? The course aims to introduce some basic VUCA concepts, in order to broaden their world view of management and nature of managing complex problems. The first half of the course introduces some of these trends, while the second half provides tools and possible frameworks to deal with the VUCA aspects that they will face in the future."
COR2001,Community Service,"Community Service is a credit-bearing graduation requirement under the Communities pillar of the SMU Core Curriculum. The Community Service experience serves as a unique experiential learning opportunity for students to undergo development in personal mastery, global citizenry, collaboration and project management skills.

To further integrate our co-curriculum with the academic curriculum, one course unit (1 CU) will be awarded for community service for students matriculated from AY2019-20 onwards. The Community Service programme is enhanced to focus more on learning outcomes and help students to better understand and apply their learning. The enhanced credit-bearing Community Service programme will impart service learning knowledge and equip students with skills to conduct critical needs analysis and asset mapping, so as to help them provide more impactful and sustainable service to the community. The programme will also include a Reflective Practice unit to equip students with the skills for deeper and more meaningful reflection.

Students matriculated from AY2019-20 onwards (excluding students in the Bachelor of Laws programme) will be awarded 1 CU, upon successful completion of the Community Service requirements. For students in the Bachelor of Laws programme, Community Service is a non-credit bearing graduation requirement."
COR2100,Economics and Society,"In this course, we introduce students to the economic way of thinking about societal issues. We use the themes of incentives and empiricism to illustrate the power of simple economic ideas, and their ability to explain, predict, and improve what happens in the world. The course will examine how market activities are shaped by both the private and public sector. It will allow students to appreciate how free markets and government policies affect society, creating winners and losers, and to understand the societal trade-offs implicated in an economy. The course will also examine debates on the importance of social institutions in contributing to economic growth, and on economic policies surrounding the world financial crisis. Two topics related to Growth in Asia will be covered in the course."
COR2201,Technology and World Change,"In Technology and World Change, we show our students how technology has changed and continues to change the lives of people and society. We study the processes by which technology and the modern society have co-evolved, especially how the past provides insights on potential changes in the future. We study specific examples of how technological innovations have been created, refined and implemented by entrepreneurs, larger corporations or industrial systems. This course trains students to think critically in a broad-based, interdisciplinary manner, and to analyze matters of potential uncertainty and ambiguity. After this course, students should be more perceptive to opportunities for innovations and technological change, regardless of the industry they will be in."
COR2202,"Science, Environment and Empire","This module is designed to introduce students to some key concepts within environmental  history and STS studies, especially the impact and control of science and technology, with  particular focus on the risks that these have posed to environmental sustainability and society in parts of Asia historically. Focusing on the history of the British Empire in Asia as a way of thinking around such issues, it uses imperial history as a lens into the development of ideas in environmental, medical and climatic science. It also considers the technological transformations that enabled and facilitated global imperial expansion. In so doing it considers imperialism s role in environmental change in Asia; the transposition of scientific thought between West and East and, the evolution of environmentalism as a movement. It also seeks to promote interdisciplinary thinking about critical contemporary challenges by thinking through the complex historical interconnections of society, environment and science."
COR2203,Climate Change: Global and Local Solutions,"This course introduces students to climate change, both within cities and globally, through a predominant STS perspective. Through in-class seminars incorporating digital platforms and field trips, students will examine the basic science underpinning present knowledge of climate change; explore the impacts of rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and rising sea levels on society; and discuss the role of technology and its management towards climate change adaptation and mitigation solutions and policies.

Case studies from Singapore and the region will be presented, and special attention focused towards the latest research on (i.) socio-economic inequalities that heighten risks towards urban populations, and (ii.) how technological innovation evolves with applied nature-based solutions in reducing climate vulnerabilities.

By the end of the course, the student should be cognisant on the potential of effective and practical management in reducing the impacts of environmental hazards to coupled human-environmental systems, and have the ability to assess solutions to adapt to and mitigate climate change impacts on important industries. Climate change will continue to wreck devastating social and economic impact in the years to come. The ability to understand and devise effective solutions to mitigate the impact of climate change across industries will be a valuable core skill enabling SMU graduates to maintain agility as they progress in their careers."
COR2204,Science and Technology Studies: Where Science meets Society,"Today, knowledge and social development are unthinkable without one another. Science and Technology Studies (STS) is the interdisciplinary study of how science and technology shape society and the environment, and conversely, how society and the environment shape science and technology. Innovation and maturation, systems and regulation, risk and failure are the key notions that exemplify this dynamic relationship. In this course, we will analyze what science is, how it works, and how society provides the means and framework for scientific and technological knowledge. We will draw from various perspectives in the humanities and social sciences, including those of history, anthropology, sociology and public policy to explore different forms of interaction between science, technology, and society. In other words, we will examine the connections between scientific theories and practices, and our social, cultural, economic, and political lives. Specific topics covered include nuclear power and waste, regulation of the internet, data and self-hood, as well as climate change politics. The first unit introduces central ideas in Science and Technology Studies (STS). In unit two, we focus on assumptions and authority of science and technology, asking who benefits from how particular research agendas or new technologies are designed, and who bears the risks of living with uncertain science or dangerous technologies. The final unit explores controversial issues in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), and examines how policy-makers, scientists and STS scholars have addressed conflict and controversy."
COR2205,"Climate, History and Society","This module aims to introduce students to topics within the emerging field of climate history. After an overview of the field, it focuses on two trajectories. First the complex relationship between society and climate. Whilst we are well aware today how humans have shaped our climate, the story of how climate has shaped us is less well understood. Climate has played a role in socio-political changes including the rise and fall of civilisations, to the shaping of socio-cultural traditions and customs. Second, it looks at the development of the science of climate and the meteorology. It explores climate science as a global phenomenon, influenced by scientific ideas and movements that circulated across borders and empires, but also as a response to local circumstances, especially extremes of weather. It also considers some of the broader challenges being faced because of climate change today and the role of the historian in current climate change debate. It has a particular focus on Asia and the exchange of knowledge about climate and weather between East and West."
COR2206,Digital Cultures,"This course explores key themes in the encroachment of digital technologies into everyday life, and the subsequent emergence of  digital cultures . It considers the ways in which digital technologies have enabled the constraints of space and time to be overcome, business processes to be disrupted, new forms of content to be reproduced, identities and communities to be forged, and cities to be managed. It also considers the ways in which they have led to new expressions of power and control, new channels of resistance, and new forms of inequality."
COR2208,Technological Solutions to Urban Challenges,"This course explores the idea of technological and innovative  solutions  in the context of the contemporary social, political, and economic challenges facing cities. It situates these technological solutions, and the global suppliers thereof, in the wider relationship between processes of problem-solving and metropolitan governance. It adopts interdisciplinary perspectives from science and technology studies, urban studies and urban planning, critical policy studies, geography, and sociology to evaluate the nature, scale, and effectiveness of these solutions to city challenges locally and globally. Drawing on case studies internationally as well as from Singapore, students will learn about: (a) different technological tropes of urban solutions; (b) the history and culture of technocratic problem-solving in the urban context; (c) the global capitalist landscape of urban solutions providers, in particular technology companies; and (d) Singapore s peculiar standing as a self-styled, ideal-type  model  of urban solutions, particularly for countries and cities in the Global South. Particular emphasis will be laid on the increasingly important role of technology companies as suppliers of  solutions  for urban challenges, as well as on critical perspectives of place, politics, and power, to continually ask questions of who has the power to define  problems  and  solutions .  Over thirteen weeks of readings, field-trips, and seminar discussions, students will learn to problematize and critically reflect on the contradictory conceptions of  solutions  and  problems  in the context of (global) metropolitan governance from the distinctive position of a putative  model  city."
COR2209,"Can Machines Think? AI in History, Philosophy, and Fiction","The newest development in machine learning methods, such as Deep Neural Networks, brought about ubiquitous proclamations of a radical societal change. Amidst utopian visions of technological enthusiasts and dystopian scenarios advanced by the sceptics that proliferate in media, some basic questions about the aims and the tools of AI remain obscured. ""Can Machines think ?  This class takes one of the central questions addressed to and by the proponents of the AI, artists, and philosophers as an entry point to consider the current emphasis on the transformative potential of machine learning from a historical perspective.

Therefore, the course structure is mostly chronological. We will situate the field of AI in the long tradition of automata construction, as well as in the context of a cold war meta-discipline of cybernetics. We will read the original works of the founders of the field, such as Alan Turing and John McCarthy, to reconstruct the main lines of the intellectual development of the field as well as its paradoxes. We will also overview some of the main philosophical and ethical debates around the notions of  intelligence,""  rationality,"" and  mind  in light of the computational technics for decision making. Finally, the course materials include a selection of science fiction novels, films, and short stories in order to discuss the notion of technological imagination as a link connecting public science, cultural production, and the formation of a scientific/engineering research programs."
COR2210,Technological Innovations Enhancing Urban Sustainability,"This course provides students with a set of interweaving and interdisciplinary concepts across the social sciences regarding the what, the how and the why regarding the implementation of technology on urban sustainability issues. Topics to be covered include (i.) sustainability in cities, particularly in the context of environmental and climate change; (ii.) the role of technology in enhancing and disrupting  normal  ways of life in the city, through the use of shared riding/food delivery apps, and social media and (iii.) how technology applied judiciously can enhance liveability and livelihoods for a wide range of urban residents who are both technology-savvy and residents uncomfortable using technology. Students will gain an understanding of how selected industries consider and apply these technologies towards urban sustainability issues. While there will be some in-class meetings to discuss theoretical concepts, learning will be primarily experiential in nature through class discussion, group exercises, and a team project. Guest speakers with practical and industrial experience may be invited as well. The course project will work with one industry sponsor (Facebook Asia). Students are expected to conceive solution to address a defined problem statement, related to an aspect of urban sustainability with societal impact, and in accordance to the real-world needs of the industry sponsor."
COR2212,Epidemics - Biomedicine and Global Health,"The past 20 years have seen several epidemics and pandemics: 2003 SARS, 2009 Flu Pandemic, the continuing Ebola outbreaks since 2014, and now, COVID-19. Discussions about preparedness for an outbreak abound and systems of biological research, biomedical interventions, and global health measures are implemented to contain and resolve an outbreak. Governments and communities respond by suspending some privileges as scientists and institutions fast-track therapeutic solutions. While these events may feel  unprecedented,  epidemics have occurred in the past. The key is to understand what has changed and what has remained similar. This course examines epidemics from the perspectives of history of biomedicine, global health, and the life sciences. Understanding the history of epidemics will help us attain a comprehensive understanding about what epidemics actually are. This knowledge will also aid in our social responses to COVID-19 in our everyday lives, chart informed biomedical interventions and potential socio-political actions. We will explore questions such as, How have epidemics shaped society? How did the biomedical practices around epidemics arise? Are vaccines really the  magic bullet  to solve all of our problems?"
COR2213,Biotechnology in a Global Society,"Biotechnology has emerged as one of the most promising and potentially profitable fields for venture capital, the government, health practitioners, consumers, and patients. Some biotechnological companies like 23andMe promise clients access to their ancient ancestry with a simple DNA swab. Scientists have harnessed the power of cloning that promises miraculous cures through stem cell therapies. Many patients have pinned their hopes in the secrets of the BRCA genes to find that elusive cure for breast cancer. But what is biotechnology? How did the field emerge and for what purpose? What are the potentials and dangers of this new field? Who actually benefits from new biotechnologies? This course will explore these questions by examining the modern history of biotechnology and its embedding in a global, capitalist society. We will trace the political ideals, scientific developments, technological infrastructures, and new economic modes that made biotechnology possible."
COR2214,What is this thing called Science?,"This course is aimed at anyone who wants to gain an understanding of the place of science in our world and how it relates to other parts of our culture.
Science plays a central role in our lives. It is the source of new technological developments, and of information about safety and risks that are relevant to our decisions as individuals and as a society. Yet many people find science disquieting. There is a feeling that science destroys the wonder of nature. Moreover, many people mistrust what scientists tell them.
In this course we will dive into an investigation of the nature of science and its place in modern culture. Among the questions to be addressed are: What distinguishes science from non-science? Are there limits to what science can or should explain? Should we place our trust in science? How can we, as non-scientists, tell whether we should rely on what news reports tell us about the results of scientific studies? What is the role and value of science in a democratic society?"
COR2217,"Situating the Machine: Technology, Politics, and Societies","Take your smartphone out and study it. Its shape and functions do you wonder how they were influenced by social, economic, political, and cultural forces? Do you think it changed the way people interact with one another? And when you look at it, does it give you hope or make you nervous about what may come? In this class, we will explore how technological artifacts and systems  from the ships early factories to the internet have shaped (and are shaped by) social, cultural, economic, and political factors. The course s underlying premise is that  technology a concept that carries a multifaceted ideological baggage only makes sense when understood as being embedded in specific social, material, and ideological configurations. That is to say, there are histories of technologies. Instead of a comprehensive survey, the course will unfold through chronologically arranged topics that include the emergence of industrial society, imperial mobility, urban spectacles, systems of mass production, gendered consumption, digital cultures, risk in the Anthropocene, and technological imaginings. The unifying theme weaving all these topics together will be that far from being deterministic, technology is instead better understood as a site of contestation and negotiation for different visions of society. So that students can dig deeper into those tensions, each week will feature not only scholarly readings, but also two primary source-driven case studies in which groups will explore the complex intersection between technology and society including Singaporean rickshaws, the Magnitogorsk Soviet industrial city, the contraceptive pill, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. For their final project, students will select a technological artifact and write a historical essay about its development and/or use."
COR2218,Outbreak: Epidemics and Pandemics in the Modern World,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 presented the global scientific community with major challenges, from uncovering the origins of this new strain of coronavirus to developing a vaccine to help prevent future outbreaks. However, epidemics and pandemics are not just biological phenomena they are also intimately intertwined with society and culture. Throughout history different communities have found diverse ways to make sense of and tackle the rapid spread of disease. In turn, those intense experiences have shaped questions concerning rights and responsibilities, the boundaries of belonging, and risk and prevention. This course introduces students to the different ways humanists and social scientists have approached the study of communicable diseases in the modern era. It begins with discussions of how to talk about and how to frame this field of study, and then follows a loosely chronological structure starting with nineteenth-century debates about the nature of cholera and ending with the complex relationship between emerging viruses and globalization. On the way we explore how tropical diseases helped shape and were shaped by colonialism; the networks that connect diseases, vectors, and populations; the fraught history of vaccine resistance; the massive mobilization in response to the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic; and the way stigma and activism has defined the HIV/AIDS pandemic."
COR2219,Heated Debates: Climate Justice,"This course is aimed at anyone who wants to gain an understanding of climate change, the moral problems it raises, and the responsibilities we have, individually and collectively, because of it. This course will consider several interrelated issues connected to climate change. Such issues include: What ethical challenges does climate change raise? Who has a right to what emission levels? How do we negotiate between collective and individual self-interests? What would
constitute a just allocation of the burdens of climate change? What can economic analysis tell us (and not tell us) about climate change? In what ways does uncertainty challenge our ability to understand what we should do about climate change? Why might geoengineering be morally problematic? What are we individually and collectively required to do about climate change? What are our responsibilities toward future generations and the environment, and how do we take these into account?
This course will examine the science, and look closely at the interplay of science and public policy. It will also look at the role of values in science.
This course will approach these issues from a variety of perspectives. Readings will drawn from climate science, philosophy, economics, environmental studies, public policy, and popular media, among other sources."
COR2220,Digital Law and Technological Innovations,"This course is dedicated to curious laypersons. In your professional life after graduation, whatever your chosen field, you will face two certainties. First, a professional matter which involves machine learning or the Blockchain. Second, you will work with a lawyer! This course gives you a toolkit, a shorthand for constructive dialogue with a lawyer s concerns, to solve your problems within your domain expertise.
Consider this example: what is your understanding of a  token ? A banker might think about asset ownership records, and link a  token  to  accounts . To a programmer, a  token  could be a technical standard for a fungible unit of value on the Blockchain. In contrast, a lawyer understands a  token  based on legislation or judge-made law. Significantly, lawyers have an exclusive right to advocate for all your professional interests in a court of law.
This course will cover legal reactions to technological innovations in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. We will examine case studies in Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain concerning, for instance, autonomous vehicles and smart contracts, which are dumb contracts.
Lawyers are trained to shape these realities with words by manipulating natural language. You will understand how   and why - lawyers convert the realities of algorithms and codes into legalese to mitigate harm against persons, to aid commercial growth and resolve its disputes."
COR2221,AI and Humanity,"Technology (specifically AI) has evolved beyond a technical proposition to a shaping force of our future, interwoven into social, cultural and political elements of human society.
We are at the genesis of how the relationship between humans and AI is evolving. More than ever, it is crucial to examine a fundamental question of what does it mean to be a human (and AI). Can AI perceive, communicate and sense as well as humans do, or perhaps even better? Such pertinent questions require a multidisciplinary lens, which this course equips you with to dexterously navigate an unfolding future as leaders of today. Venture beyond an academic discourse and gain hands-on experience as a psychologist and AI scientist to develop an AI powered chatbot."
COR2222,AI for Social Transformation,"The notion that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the capacity to transform the way society operates has long been a part of popular culture. Androids have been dreaming of electric sheep since 1968, and Tom Cruise was already arresting pre-criminals in 2002. With the explosion of data available to governments and companies, and cloud computing platforms making supercomputing power widely available, science fiction and reality have never been closer.
However, the true capabilities and limitations of AI are often poorly understood, as some predict doom, while others promise the moon. Modern AI techniques have the capacity to improve the way organisations operate, improving decision-making and increasing human and environmental wellbeing, but also carry the potential to cause harm if used irresponsibly or ignorantly.
Accessible to technical and non-technical students alike, this course will introduce you to key techniques, showing how they can be flexibly applied to a range of problems, from using game theory to intercept wildlife poachers, through machine learning models for crime prediction, to risk-aware logistics scheduling. The course will guide you through the ethical implications of AI, considering the effects of biased data and the uncritical application of techniques. By the end of
the course you will have a working understanding of the capacities and limitations of practical AI, equipping you to critically analyse new developments, and engage in responsible, informed decision-making in the workplace."
COR2223,Frontiers of Modern Computing: Present Essentials and Future Promises,"The pace of development in modern computing can be bewildering. New technologies appear, making headlines, yet the important details of what they are and how they work often seem to be secrets that are accessible to only an initiated few. This course provides an introduction to the hot technologies in modern computing, demystifying terminology and breaking down the relevant technical information for students of all backgrounds. The course scope encompasses both hot topics that grab headlines, and recent developments that have become central to modern computing infrastructure, understanding how the technology developed to this point, and examining where it may progress in the future. Typical topics include blockchain, Internet of Things, cloud computing and machine learning.
This course will equip you with an understanding of key contemporary technologies. It does not shy away from technical details, but presents them in an accessible manner so that you can grasp the capabilities and purpose of the tools discussed. As advances in computing methods are evolved from existing techniques, the insights gained from this course will also give you a head start in getting to grips with further developments in computing in the future. You will also be invited to consider the ethical implications and moral responsibilities of deploying the technologies that pervade our daily lives."
COR2224,"AI: Past, Present, and Future","What is AI? How does it work, and how do we use it to solve problems? This course co-taught by three experts is an integrative endeavour that strives to address the development of AI technologies across disciplines, across theory and practice, and across past, present, and future. It will introduce students to the fundamental ideas of AI, combining perspectives from history, technology, and
business to develop a well-rounded understanding of the origins of the field, its current state of the art, as well as aspirations for the future. With insights from real industry case studies, you will acquire a practical knowledge of the ways AI techniques can, or cannot yet, enhance organisational operations.
You will hone your critical thinking skills and practice the problem-solving process that analysts employ in the deployment of AI solutions. Looking ahead, you will gain a preview of the future directions of AI as set by government policies and developing technologies while confronting their social, cultural, and ethical implications."
COR2226,"Information Technology Policy, Law and Regulations","New economies have emerged within the last two decades including digital models of transaction and disruptive innovations to major industries. Electronic commerce has become ubiquitous as is digital forms of human interaction and communication. Also, Internet intermediaries have taken on a major role as facilitators of commercial and non-commercial transactions online. These include social networking platforms (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok and Twitter), multimedia sharing platforms (e.g. YouTube, Apple Music, Spotify), search engines and news aggregators (e.g. Yahoo and Google), content hosts and storage facilities (e.g. Dropbox) and many others. Law and policy have to be adapted to deal with the roles and functions of such forms of engagement and the parties involved. Regulators in every jurisdiction are faced with the challenge to manage the new economy and players, and to balance the interest of multiple parties, in the context of areas of law including intellectual property, data protection, cloud technology and cyber-security. The social effects of the development and use of Infocomm technology have to be tackled as well, including privacy, harassment, cyberstalking and access to content.

Students taking this course will be introduced to the legal issues and solutions arising from transactions through the use of digital information, goods and services as well as via non-physical - analog and digital - channels of communication and delivery. The technological developments from Web 1.0 to 2.0 and the future of Web 3.0 with its impact on human interaction and B2B/B2C commerce as well as e-governance will be examined in the context of civil and criminal law. In particular, this course examines the laws specifically arising from and relating to electronic transactions and interaction and their objectives and impact on the individual vis- -vis other parties. Students will be taken through the policy considerations and general Singapore legislations and judicial decisions on the subject with comparisons and reference to foreign legislation where relevant. In particular, students will be introduced to the policy behind, and the general effects of the law, relating to electronic commerce and other forms of transactions. The Electronic Transactions Act and the Singapore domain name framework; the privacy related laws and the Personal Data Protection Act; the Protection from Harassment Act; the Singapore Copyright provisions relating to Infocomm; the Computer Misuse Act and the Broadcasting Act and its regulations (including the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act."
COR2228,Ethnographies of Climate Change,"What is ethnographic research? How can it help us understand the complex nature and differentiated impacts of climate change? And how might it help to orient our approaches to addressing this ongoing global transformation? Grounded in cutting-edge scholarship from the anthropology of climate change and science and technology studies (STS), the course will explore these questions through a range of ethnographic readings and films. We will use a diverse set of ethnographic case studies to examine the structures and systems in which climate knowledge and responses are embedded, as well as the complexities of making both atmospheric carbon and its lived impacts legible across domains. The difficulties of scale   climate change s dual character as both an existential, species-wide threat and a particular, localized set of material challenges   will also be emphasized throughout. In addition to considering the insights of climate anthropologists, students will develop their own ethnographic research skills through in-class methods exercises. They will then apply these tools in the course's culminating assignment, an extended ethnographic case study of climate change knowledge, subjectivity, or response within Singapore."
COR2229,Game Theory for Modern Challenges,"This course uses some of the most pressing global problems to motivate learning of the concepts and methods of game theory. Game theory is the branch of mathematics that deals with strategic interactions: situations where the benefits and costs of each agent or actor depends not just on her actions but also on the actions chosen by other agents. Many problems of global concern, like climate change, the use of artificial intelligence, pandemics, and great power conflicts, are characterized by the tension between self-interest and cooperation, miscommunication, and misalignment of incentives. Game theory is a powerful and incisive tool to analyse these issues because it has been used extensively to address collective-action challenges, which are at the heart of most game-theoretical applications in the social sciences; moreover, solutions to these challenges must account for information manipulation and unintended consequences, which are core game theory concepts.  Collective-action problems are situations where the objectives of the whole society or collective are best served if its members take a particular action or actions; however, as these actions are costly, and one can free-ride on others  actions, individuals are disincentivized from cooperating. To solve these problems, game theory looks at how the strategic interaction among members can be improved to generate cooperation.  This course is designed for non-economics majors who want an accessible but also comprehensive and challenging introduction to the game-theoretic tools and principles essential for understanding the nature and possible solutions to collective-action problems without taking a standard game theory course. It is placed ideally within the Technology and Society basket, as it addresses social dilemmas and issues with conceptual or technological links to science."

Through interdisciplinary perspectives from anthropology, geography, political economy, planning and cultural studies, we will explore diverse case studies, problems, politics and perspectives. Students will explore the possibilities and challenges of urban life over time and space   the centrality, complexity, creativity and conflicts that cities embody. The examination of cities will encompass spaces of social and cultural order/disorder, problems of social difference and the possibilities of creative responses, and the challenges and evolving meaning of individuality and collectivity in dense population spaces. Students will also examine contemporary global alternatives and pay special attention in readings to the urban experience in Singapore as the metropolitan laboratory in which we are active participants in creating and shaping. Through readings, focussed questions, discussions and assignments, students are also invited to reflect on the privileges and demands of urban citizenship itself."

COR2603,Singapore: Imagining The Next Fifty Years,"The course content is jointly developed by professors from the six local universities and will be delivered using a blended learning approach.

Singapore is both a city and a country contained in a small geographical space located in Southeast Asia.  It houses a diverse population in terms of race, language, religion, class and nationality.  It possesses no natural resources, but has a highly educated labour force.  Its economy has experienced significant growth rates, particularly in the late 70s and early 80s, coupled with low unemployment. 

Like most other more developed economies, it now confronts a range of socioeconomic issues (rapidly ageing population, declining fertility rates, widening income inequality, rising costs of living) amidst increasing global competition, technological advancements, and security threats.  At the same time, Singaporeans have become more of a people with a stronger national identity, a greater propensity to participate in the decisions that affect the destiny of the country, and a wider range of views and voices on the future direction of Singapore, the challenges it confronts, and the strategies and means by which to achieve their preferred goal(s) for themselves, their children, and the country."
COR2611,Cultural History of the Cold War in Asia,"This course explores the Cold War through an in-depth and interdisciplinary analysis of the cultural materials, transformations, and modalities in Asia. First, we will explore the origins and historical background of the Cold War in Asia and examine key departures and convergences with the broader global narratives. Second, we will examine various aspects of culture - films, music, art, sports, fashion, education, among others and and probe into how the Cold War manifested in or can be analyzed through these cultural references and also to investigate how the cultural transformations, in turn, shape the nature of Cold War. Finally, we will evaluate contemporary Asian culture and identify the lasting legacies of the Cold War that still persist up until today."
COR2613,"Screening Asia: History, Society, and Politics in Films","Films are more than just entertainment products. As cultural materials, they provide insights to the historical narratives, politics, economy, and ideological complexities of societies. This course is designed to provide an interdisciplinary and visual approach to understanding Asia using films about Asia produced by Asians themselves as well as those films about Asia produced by non-Asian filmmakers. First, we will briefly explore the history of film in the Asian region and discuss various methods of reading films as texts. Second, we will critically examine what films reveal about the history of Asia - the period of colonialism, decolonization and nation-building, Cold War, and globalization in the Asian region. Next, we will explore contemporary topics and issues in Asia such as traditional and non-traditional security issues such as maritime issues, climate change, and migration, among others. Finally, we will assess the contemporary role and significance of films against the rapid technological disruptions taking place within Asia and beyond."
COR2614,Publics and Privates on The Pacific Rims,"In this course, we will explore spaces that might be marked as  publics  and  privates  in an area of the world popularly known as the  Pacific Rim.  Plotted around the geological formation of the  ring of fire,  the Pacific Rim is a geography of aspiration. The hope, for those who buy into this formation, is that integrating the markets of the Asia-Pacific in East and Southeast Asia and the west coast of the
Americas would result in world peace wrought by multicultural harmony brokered through trade. In such a market-driven region, we will explore how the terms  publics  and  privates  might be used to mark out different kinds of places, with both historical and contemporary case studies. The purpose of this course is to understand the cultures around the terms  public  and  private  as an asset to
comprehending how things might be done in this region."
COR2615,Finding Home in a Globalised World,"The contemporary world is usually described as  globalised.  Although some claim that this  global village  can be our home and that human life is improved by globalisation, others complain that the local sense of groundedness that they argue is essential to human flourishing is becoming harder to attain. In this course, we explore the big question of whether these two concepts   the global and the local   are really opposites and whether it is possible to find a home in a world that is global. These explorations will transpire through analysis and discussion of readings addressing economic, scientific, legal, philosophical, and aesthetic perspectives on the intersections of the global and local. By the end of the course, students will be expected to able to articulate their responses to whether they can find home in a globalised world by integrating the course material with their own personal experiences. This course should be of special interest to students embarking on endeavours that will take them far from home, as one objective will be for them to articulate what  home  is."
COR2616,Singapore and the Question of Cosmopolitanism,"This course employs an inter-disciplinary approach to study the development of conceptions of cosmopolitanism in the Singapore context from the pre-colonial era through the contemporary period. It is concerned with the local, regional and global influences that have shaped the evolving meanings of cosmopolitanism for Singapore and its inhabitants. In particular, the course explores how these evolving meanings of cosmopolitanism emerge from negotiations and contests between Singapore s leaders and peoples. Seminal events such as the founding of modern Singapore by agents of the British Empire, the Japanese occupation of Singapore during World War II, and the nationalist strivings of Singaporeans in the Cold War period, will feature prominently, as will debates over their significance and contribution to Singapore s identity as a cosmopolitan city."
COR2617,Twentieth Century Southeast Asia: A Playground for Empires?,"This course explores major events and developments in Southeast Asia s encounter with empires in the twentieth century. Students will learn to critique the involvement of western and Asian colonial powers in the Southeast Asian region, paying particular attention to the responses of Southeast Asian peoples. More than simply a political and diplomatic history, or a study of international relations, this course focuses on how culture race, religion and gender shapes the region s encounter with western and Asian powers. Seminal events that will feature in this course include the rise of communism in Europe and China, the ascension of the Japanese Empire, the outbreak of the Pacific War, the neo-colonial/ recolonization efforts of the European powers, the surge in Southeast Asian nationalism that intertwined with the Cold War, and major developments in the post-Vietnam War era."
COR2618,"Food Cultures - Are We What, Where and How We Eat?","This course conceptualizes food and food consumption as a deeply spatial, political, economic and socio-cultural phenomena. Through interdisciplinary perspectives from anthropology, geography, political economy, sociology and cultural studies, we will explore diverse case studies, problems, politics and perspectives about food. Students will interrogate the centrality, complexity, creativity and conflicts surrounding food over societies, time and space. The examination of food, with particular attention to Singapore, will encompass discussions on issues including the ethics of food production/consumption, patterns of diet and dieting, the politics of sustainable food production, and hybrid food cultures. Students will also examine contemporary global responses to the global food shortage and pay special attention to food cultures in Singapore as the metropolitan kitchen in which we are active participants. Through readings, focused questions, discussions and assignments, students are also invited to reflect on their own patterns of food consumption."
COR2619,Fashioning a Nation,"Nations have long sought to evoke loyalty and personal attachment, while in turn providing those living within it with a collective experience and common destiny. The potent force of the nation as a cognitive idea is at the heart of this course, which conceives of the making of a nation as an ongoing work in progress in which everyone has a stake. The central question that we will investigate concerns the reciprocal influences between the nation, its institutional manifestations and  the people . How do  the people  shape institutions and fashion a nation on a daily basis and vice versa?
To explore these relationships, the course is structured around three themes: prerequisites, process and practice. The first theme provides the general conceptual framework through a series of brief discussions of what a nation is, how it relates to a state and to a  people . The second theme is devoted to what is often seen as the quintessential nation-building moment: the formal drafting of a constitution. We will consider the choice of language in that text to harness the people s fidelity to the budding nation as well as the respective roles played by the elites and ordinary citizens during the constitution-process. For the third theme, we will probe the lived reality of how the nation constitutes itself every day through its people, from the elites who claim to speak on behalf of the nation in formal rule-making to the personification of the nation in image, song and icon to the architectural design of state institutions and public spaces and the wearing of folk costumes or traditional outfits that seek to give expression to the identity of the nation.
Our explorations will feature the experiences of a diverse range of nations located within and outside Asia. These will provide the backdrop against which the Singapore story will be considered, thereby allowing students to interrogate the familiar domestic narrative of nation-building from a comparative angle. The approach taken will be practically grounded and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from law, political theory, history, linguistics, architecture and the arts. To do so effectively, the course will be team-taught by two instructors with complementary disciplinary backgrounds."
COR2620,Redefining the Third Age in Singapore,"This course aims to equip young leaders with an understanding of the impact of an ageing population on society, and in particular the emerging cohort of Singaporeans in their Third Age. The notion of the third age was introduced by gerontologists as it became clear that the discourse on ageing covers a heterogeneous group of individuals who may be of the same age chronologically, but who in terms of personal characteristics and life experience are quite different. This third age of human existence is characterised by retirement from full-time work and a new way of spending time (Carr & Komp, 2011). Through class discussions and group projects, students will dive deeper into disciplines like gerontology, social sciences (intergenerational; social connectedness), public policy (successful ageing), economics (retirement) and technological developments in the ageing space. Students will explore case studies and challenges of a rapidly ageing society in Singapore and around the world such as Japan, China, USA, Australia, Netherlands etc."
COR2621,"Making Peace in, and with, a World at War","Humans have been making war and peace throughout their recorded history. We can be fairly certain this was the case well before civilization emerged. Conflicts always seem to erupt over scarce resources, contentious values and ideas, fissures in relationships, fault-lines in societies, the list goes on. And, intertwined with these conflicts are efforts to end violence, to heal wounds and reconcile, to share resources, to create or re-establish a semblance of harmony between peoples. Most of all will perceive these human activities as binary opposites, as mutually exclusive, leading us to invest particular meanings in each to distinguish them further from each other. Indeed, thanks to influences from culture, media, from our communities, families and leaders, we typically perceive war and peace as suffering versus happiness, action not stillness, a zone of masculine combat versus one of safety for women and children, and much more. These ingrained perceptions shape our decisions, actions and relationships in fundamental ways, determining our behaviour and experiences in all spaces and times, whether we have construed them to be in the context of war, peace, and anything beyond or in-between. Since our views of war and peace are so fundamental to our life experience, this course asks us for a deeper engagement of our prior knowledge.

Through critical engagement with a variety of disciplines and empirical contexts, we will consider the intertwined phenomena of war and peace in theory and praxis. The course explores the value systems we attach to each, why, and with what consequences for ourselves and others? We investigate how our notions of war and peace contribute directly to the construction of our identity as well as ideas about belonging, power, justice, progress, and more. In so doing, we look into the ways people, their customs, laws and culture respond to their perceptions and experiences of war and peace; reflect on how they debate the purposes of war-making and peace-making; and discuss how they compete and cooperate for the spoils of both war and peace. Also, we will study how our knowledge of war and peace may continually change over time. By the end of the course, students will have an expansive understanding of how these two phenomena come together in ways that structure and define their everyday lives."
COR2622,Asia and World Literature: Beyond Orientalism,"This course surveys the complex cultural and political relationships that exist between Asia and World Literature, exploring how canonical works of prose, poetry and drama have been used (and continue to be used) to advance divergent imperialist, nationalist and intercultural goals. We begin by tracing the formation of  Orientalist  stereotypes about Asia in World Literature, illuminating the role these texts played in the Western colonial project. Next, we interrogate how Asian nationalists and creative practitioners sought to move beyond these Orientalist tropes by adapting Shakespeare s plays to create bold, new intercultural performances. We then dive into a range of canonical Asian texts and their contemporary adaptations. We ask what these texts can tell us about the connected political, cultural and technological histories of Asia and Europe; probe how these texts play shape our perceptions of racial, religious, national and gender differences; and ponder the place Singapore writers have in world literature today."
COR2623,Tocqueville's Democracy in America and Beyond,"Hailed as  the greatest book on democracy ever written,  Tocqueville s Democracy in America offers a window into much more than the United States visited by Alexis de Tocqueville in the 1830s. Indeed, Tocqueville believed he  saw in America  an image of the future everywhere, for he believed that equality of conditions from which democratic society grew was the world s inevitable future.  Having reached its most developed form in the United States, equality of conditions modified and transformed all aspects of life, from politics to social relations, to personal relations, to intellectual life, to individual character and values. Given this radical transformation of the world, Tocqueville believed that  A new political science is needed for a world entirely new,  and Democracy in America articulates this new political science.  Tocqueville s masterpiece, then, looks beyond its US context, for Tocqueville hoped to teach his readers what they could hope and fear from democracy, as well as how democratic society might be  educated  to avoid some of the dangers to which it is prone. 

This course takes its inspiration from Tocqueville s ambition, by approaching Democracy in America thematically and using Tocqueville s study as a basis for broader inquiry into features of contemporary democratic society. Each week of the course will focus on a key theme in Democracy in America, and each week will pair that theme with current scholarship applying and extending elements of the Tocquevillian perspective to contemporary contexts. By the end of the course, students will have gained familiarity with key elements of the Tocquevillian analysis of democratic society as well as critical perspectives on how these themes have continued to play out in current scholarship and debates."
COR2626,"Imagining the Self: Literature, Ethnicity and Gender in Asia","This course explores what literature can tell us about the changing nature of gender and ethnic identities across modern Asian cultures. We interrogate what  selfhood  means to a range of established and emerging Asian writers, asking how and why they construct gender and ethnic identities in their works, and what insights this provides into the Asian psyche. We begin by interrogating gender in Singapore, asking how dramatists and novelists envision life as a  woman  or a  man  here. We then circle outwards across Indonesia, India and Iran, tracing how letters, novels, films and graphic novels have been used to create and challenge gender norms from the colonial 19th century to the postcolonial 21st. Next, we look at ethnicity, debating its relative mutability, and querying the importance of physical markers of  racial  difference relative to evolving national borders and spiritual and societal practices. We trace how Singaporean and Malaysian writers construct ethnicity in their prose fiction, before considering how authors further afield in East Asia (Japan and China) and West Asia (Turkey and Afghanistan) have re-interpreted communal identities over time. We conclude by considering the future of ethnic and gender identities in Asia. By the end of this literary odyssey, students will have gained a wide-ranging appreciation of how modern Asian writers envision gender and ethnicity, and contemplated the relevance of these fictive visions to their own sense of selfhood as young adults living in Asia."
COR2627,European Cultural History: From Antiquity to Brexit,"Cultural history brings to life past epochs and places. In this pursuit, it analyses beliefs and ideas, products of artistic nature, as well as the objects and experiences of everyday life, such as clothing or cuisine. Culture also encompasses attitudes, values, assumptions and prejudices, and the rituals and practices that express them. In this regard, our current thoughts and acts have an ancestry which cultural history can illuminate and critically examine.

This course explores fundamental moments in the history of Europe: from the foundations in Greece and Rome, through the alliances, conflicts and revolutions that transformed it, and key periods such as the Enlightenment and Modernism, that significantly shaped it. They all help understand the complexities of today's Europe, from the challenges in cultural integration to Brexit. Through lectures, key readings, analyses of case studies and research projects, this course broadens understanding of Europe. By establishing linkages between history, socio-political and economic contexts, religion, and art forms, it reveals crucial intersections to comprehend the landmarks of the cultural history of Europe."
COR2628,"Refocusing Wealth and Poverty: Relations, Forms, Causes & Strategies","The pursuit of wealth in its various forms has been prominent throughout recorded history. The desire to accumulate resources is found across civilisations. Yet, should wealth simply measured in economic and financial terms? Should poverty be only measured through the same lens? Many cultures promote the virtues of prudence and fortitude, peppered with ideals of justice and equality in its various guises. Wealth and poverty are often seen as diametric. Despite this, several traditions point to the need for thinking through forms of wealth (and poverty) beyond the conventional lens of economics, and to consider the pursuit of wealth of time, happiness, peace, relationships, and other elements that enrich the human experience. It is little wonder that in our contemporary age, several scholars have pointed towards the reprioritisation of wealth accumulation towards one that places happiness, health and other non-monetary goals as the ideal. In this course, we will be exploring substantially several forms of wealth (beyond the conventional), and to consider carefully the causes and strategies to address the challenges related to wealth and poverty in our contemporary world.

Through critical engagement with a variety of disciplines and empirical contexts, we will consider the intertwined phenomena of wealth and poverty in theory and praxis. The course explores the value systems we attach to each, why, and with what consequences for ourselves and others. We investigate how our notions of wealth and poverty contribute directly to the construction of our identity as well as ideas about inequality, power, justice, progress, and more. In so doing, we look into the ways people, their customs, laws and culture respond to their perceptions and experiences of wealth and poverty; reflect on how they debate the purposes and outcomes of wealth and poverty; and discuss how they compete and cooperate for limited resources in our contemporary world. Also, we will study how our knowledge and conception of wealth and poverty may continually change over time. By the end of the course, students will have an expansive understanding of how these two phenomena come together in ways that structure and define their everyday lives."
COR2631,Scratches on their Minds: Images of Asia in Hollywood,"Film is one of the most important cultural materials through which we learn about people, places, and ideas past and present. Film mirrors and co-produces our understanding of the world and our place in it. Through film, we encounter societies and cultures beyond our own; and the world sees images of who we are through
filmic representations of ourselves. In this course, we explore the ways in which film has served as a space for the production, contestation, and meditation of representations and images of Asia in the United States through the lens of Hollywood films.
This course is designed to provide an interdisciplinary and visual approach to understanding Asia's representations and images on/in Hollywood films. First, we will briefly explore America s perceptions and ideas about Asia in the late 19th century and discuss various methods of reading films as texts. Second, we will
critically examine what Hollywood films reveal about America s perceptions and ideas about Asia within the context of Asia s entangled history with the United States from the late 19th century to 1990s - from the period of American imperial expansion, America s orientalism, US occupation of Japan, the Cold War, and
America s involvement in Vietnam. Next, we will explore the recent trajectories in Hollywood that shaped/reconfigured Asia s filmic representation - the commodification of Asia in Hollywood, the impact of 9/11 on Hollywood s image of Asia, and the shifting aspects of Asian identities (gender and race) in
contemporary Hollywood films. Finally, we will examine the rising influence of Asia (its film industries, states, and societies) in global/Hollywood filmmaking and discuss how these disruptions and changes will impact Asia, the United States, and the rest of the world."
COR3001,Big Questions,"Big Questions will take a theme every year, or a major global challenge broadly defined as a thesis and its (seeming) antithesis. Big Questions will introduce students to the challenging ethical, theoretical, and operational debates that attend to these themes. Students in any given year will be able to choose from a menu of sub-themes, each using a different disciplinary lens and focusing on different aspects of the theme, while also sharing a canon of readings and attending public lectures dedicated to the year s theme for a shared intellectual experience. The themes may include Happiness and Suffering, Global and Local, Robots and Humans, Wealth and Poverty, War and Peace, amongst others."
COR3301,Ethics and Social Responsibility,"The objective of the Course is to raise the awareness of students with regard to the multi-faceted ethical and social responsibility issues faced by businesses and corporate executives, whether individuals or organisations. The initial part of the Course will focus on critiquing various ethical and social theories developed by philosophers, economists, sociologists, management theorists and others. Both Western and non-Western theories will be examined. The Course also aims at developing the moral reasoning skills of students and applying them to the specific problems and dilemmas faced by individuals and organisations in the business and corporate world."
COR3302,Ethics and Social Responsibility for Accounting,"This course discusses issues of ethics and social responsibility in the context of business in general as well as the accounting profession in particular. The different theories of ethics will be explored, together with their relevance in various personal, organisational, professional and societal settings. The challenges of recognizing situations involving ethical issues and dilemmas when they arise; understanding why individuals, organisations, professionals and governments respond to them the way they do; and identifying ways to manage or resolve them, will be examined. Real-life cases and problems will be studied."
COR3303,Ethics and Social Responsibility for Law,"The objectives of this course are twofold: First, it is expected that students will learn the fundamental principles of influential ethical theories that have guided, or have been invoked by, explicitly or implicitly, governments, citizens, businesspersons and consumers, and other stakeholders in societies for centuries. Having learned these theories, the student will be expected to achieve a degree of fluency in applying these theories to a range of different fact situations. Where relevant, references will be made to statutory provisions and legal principles (eg Prevention of Corruption Act). Second, the student will be introduced to basic principles of professional ethics in various disciplines, including accounting and law."
COR3304,Ethics and Corporate Responsibility,"In this day and age, it is no longer sufficient for managers and leaders in organizations to be simply transactional or simply transformational. They also need to be fair, just, ethical, moral and responsible. This course is designed to explore, inform, and stimulate thinking on issues related to behavioural ethics, responsibility and sustainability as encountered in the corporate world. To create this intellectual exchange, this course will focus on how individual and organizational behaviour is shaped by context as well as by biases, why these factors make it difficult for managers to be responsible leaders, and what can be done about the influence of these factors.

It is important to emphasize that the goal of this course is not the ethical or moral transformation of students but to develop a set of tools and frameworks (where possible) that allow us to manage effectively in a world increasingly characterized by stakeholders with competing needs and responsibilities."
COR-ACM2624,"Art History: Modern, Postmodern, and Contemporary","In the Western world of the mid-19th century, change was everywhere. Industry boomed, and the pace of life increased, leading to relentless urbanisation and a boost in mobility and communications. Travelling and the notion of taking a holiday were growing in popularity and a  culture of things  primed consumerism as an expression of social status. While the abolition of slavery had begun, nationalism exploded in a Europe where Imperialism brought large parts of Asia and Africa under colonial rule and introduced new interactions, dependencies, and exploitations.

Artists strove to find new ways of encapsulating this complex world through their creations. With the advent of photography and film, and new building and artistic techniques, some of the most exciting changes in art history took place. This period gave us creative universes as diverse as Monet s open-air impressions, Renoir s zest for life, Toulouse Lautrec s underground worlds, and Van Gogh s anguish.

Throughout the 20th century, new sets of media and art forms appeared, and the social structure of the art world consolidated. New construction materials were used, artistic techniques developed, and a multitude of isms (Cubism, Futurism, Expressionism, etc.) challenged previous conventions. Artists supported and even championed the advancement of social causes. They were often at the forefront of protest movements against wars and injustices and denouncing discrimination by race, gender and sexual orientation. Today, contemporary art simultaneously experiences greater accessibility and democratisation. At the same time, it also suffers an increasing level of commodification and continues to evolve as it finds new ways to innovate, inspire, and provoke its audiences.

This course examines crucial works of art from the nineteenth century to the contemporary. It provides students with a roadmap to reflect on them in an open-minded, critical and analytical way. It considers historical, economic and socio-political contexts, and focuses on the integration of art within the broader cultural environment. This course offers new perspectives into the shifting kaleidoscope of art, and by its conclusion, students will develop a profound understanding of artworks that might have previously seemed inaccessible."
COR-ACM2629,Art & History: Beginnings to Revolutions,"Art has inspired and fascinated people all over the world since the beginning of time. Since the early cave art produced more than thirty thousand years ago, every civilisation has captured its exploits, concerns and everyday life in vases, murals, sculptures, paintings and monuments. Art has always been an enduring product of human creativity, symbolic communication, and emotional expression that exists in an intriguing intersection between past and present historical contexts.

COR-LAW2630,"Introduction to Chinese History, Culture, Economy, Politics and Law","With the rise of China as an economic superpower, foreign businesses have been rushing to do business in or with China. However, many businesses encounter various problems in China. This is mostly due to their limited knowledge and understanding of China, even if they can speak Chinese. This course aims to address this problem by enhancing the students  understating of the unique history, culture, economy, politics and law in China. To help the students understand the nuances of doing business in/with China, interesting cases and events will be used to illustrate how things work in China in real life. With the knowledge acquired in the course, the students will gain a better understanding of how business is conducted in China; the interaction between business on the one hand, and culture, politics and law on the other hand; as well as how foreign firms may survive and prosper in China."
COR-LAW2215,Digital Intelligence for Lawyers,This course employs a top-down approach to introduce high-level concepts in digital technology to (1) future lawyers who expect to work closely on legal/policy matters that intersect with technology and (2) future legal professionals who intend to leverage on the power of modern computing technologies in both legal research and the delivery of legal services.
COR-LAW2216,Law for Technologies and Pandemics,"The goal of the course is to provide a broad appreciation for the intersection of emerging technologies and the law.
Often times there is not enough (or even any) law that adequately regulates a particular area.  In some instances, the courts can apply regulations and laws from similar technologies as a stopgap.    This course aims to show where the law adequately regulates an emerging technology, and where there is room for improvement.   This course will also provide a section that focuses primarily on the legal  issues that arise at the novel intersection between pandemics, technology and the law.
The course aims to have an international bent, looking at how different regimes apply their laws, and how those efforts promote or stymie innovation. 
This is a short course and it is impossible to provide even a cursory overview of all interesting and emerging technologies.  As such, this syllabus is only a guideline for potential analysis and discussion.  We will look to the students to decide what areas in particular interest them and the class will try to focus there."
COR-LAW2225,Governing for Sustainable Futures,"We live in a hyperconnected world   ecosystems and societies are linked like never before. This occurs through the movement of people, goods and products and the transfer of capital and information. At the same time, there is mounting appreciation of the need to address issues of equity and sustainability concurrently.

To adequately understand, and ultimately to govern and regulate, for equitable-sustainability there is the need to identify and appreciate the complex feedbacks across activities of multiple individual, government and corporate actors across scales from the global to the local.

This interdisciplinary course equips students with a grounding in concepts from the biophysical sciences, social sciences, law and governance. It focuses on key social, ecological and economic concerns in the context of biodiversity and climate change. By introducing students to systems and futures approaches it enables students to engage in sustainable and equitable governance for more desirable tomorrows."
COR-LAW2610,"Constitutions, Cultures, and Context","A constitution is a country s most important text: it creates State institutions, allocates powers and recognizes rights and responsibilities for those within its territory. More than that, constitutions express a state s identity and provide the framework for all other laws and policies. This course will expose students to the challenges attendant on making constitutions work. At the same time, it will sensitise them to the extent to which the wider social, political and economic context and a country s underlying culture affect the implementation of constitutional rules and values. Evergreens like the separation of powers, constitutional enforcement and dilemmas in ensuring equality and dignity will be explored through comparative study of experiences in a diverse range of jurisdictions. Instead of exploring models and constitutional solutions in the abstract, the course invites students to explore the practical impact and outcomes particular constitutional models and ideas produce in everyday life. To that end, we will amongst others compare the constitutional responses that different countries provide to contemporary challenges such as how to ensure effective public participation in governance without encouraging populism; the pervasiveness of migration for our understanding of citizenship and its entitlements; ensuring that everyone is treated equally while respecting individual autonomy and life choices; the role of technology in public life and the implications for privacy and free speech; and the role of a constitution in fostering economic development."
COR-LAW2612,Jurisprudence: Modern and Critical Theories of Law,"What is law? How is law related to justice? This course enables law students to step back to reflect upon what they have learnt in law school thus far by engaging philosophical concepts of law and justice through studying selected representative works of jurisprudence. Non-law students who are interested in philosophy or in thinking about law s nature and its role in society will also have the opportunity to study these ideas as expounded by famous legal philosophers.

We will consider accounts of law offered by several legal positivists and modern natural law theorists, and challenges posed by alternative critical accounts. How do modern and critical accounts of law shape our thinking about the nature and purpose of law? How does adopting a particular account of law impact the practice of law? How can we, as lawyers or citizenry, harness law s potential as a tool for transforming society?

Through this course, students will have a unique opportunity to engage their hearts and minds in relation to the concepts of law and justice. Students will also be encouraged to relate the theories studied to current contexts (e.g. laws that restrict personal liberty, unjust laws, how judges decide cases, and so on). The course's focus is on critique of ideas and not mere description of doctrine. The methods of assessment will be intentionally geared towards facilitating critical thought. This course encourages students to formulate their own theses about law and justice, and meaningfully understand their purpose in the legal process.

This course also offers law students a chance to study selected representative texts in jurisprudence in greater detail than in the law core module, Legal Theory & Philosophy. Students are not required to have done Legal Theory & Philosophy before taking this course."
COR-MAND2404,Mandarin,"This course is design to equip you with elementary knowledge of the structure of Han Yu Pin Yin and the correct usage of vocabulary and grammar in daily conversation. Empowered with this knowledge and with the help of Chinese dictionary, you will be able to read all Chinese characters and pronounce them accurately. These skills provide a foundation in the usage of computer to enter Chinese characters."
COR-MGMT1302,"Business, Government and Society","This course overviews the economic, legal, social, and ecological responsibilities of business and their implications for managerial decision-making.  The primary theoretical perspective taken is the stakeholder view of the firm which allows for close examination of apparently conflicting goals between different stakeholders' interests.  Related frameworks and applications discussed in this course include corporate social responsibility, globalization, corporate governance, and public policy measures affecting business. The frameworks and issues discussed are critical to understanding how firms can be both financially successful and valuable to society, a concern which is increasingly influencing managerial decision-making. Illustrations and applications to the Singapore context as a small open economy will be discussed."
COR-MGMT1303,Entrepreneurship and Business Creation,"This course is a core course for the Entrepreneurship track of the management concentration offered at the Lee Kong Chian School of Business. It can also be taken as a secondary elective for students majoring in Strategy and Organization. 

This course traces the steps that entrepreneurs likely encounter between a first recognition of a potential business opportunity to the nascent operation of the actual company.  This course teaches students the basic ingredients of a business plan and a short  pitch  for their ideas, yet shows the limitations of a static document in the changing marketplace.  Through the use of real business cases, this course helps students understand various issues that require analysis and resolution before their company can be on a more financially sustainable footing."
COR-MGMT2207,Innovations for Asias Smart Cities,"The world is rapidly urbanizing. More and more cities around the world are becoming increasingly popular as economic powerhouses and magnets for migrants from the countryside, suburban areas and other parts of the world. All big cities in both First and Third World countries as well as emerging markets such as New York, London, Tokyo, Paris, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Dehli, Jakarta etc. have to cope with high population density and serious challenges such as air pollution or traffic congestion. How do we pack more people into big cities and yet continue to achieve a high quality of life? How do we create and manage  good cities  which are safe, spacious, green, connected, fair and resilient? How can cities create economic wealth while still fulfilling the CSR responsibilities of sustaining a  Green Planet ? What are the best practice designs and technical smart city solutions which could be leveraged to tackle these challenges and how can they be successfully commercialised? This course will provide answers to these questions with special emphasis on the managerial and commercial aspects of smart city concepts.

The key lies in creating and effectively managing innovative and sustainable, smart cities able to leverage on new technologies such as smart grids or sensor networks to create a place where people can live, play and work well. Starting from the stakeholder requirements of citizens and planners of innovative cities, the course will introduce students to urban design concepts as well as commercialization, management challenges and implementation issues of the smart city model. There will also be a focus on how good governance and enabling technologies such as sensor networks can facilitate the creation, management and sustainability of  good  cities.

With the help of case studies and resource persons such as industry leaders, innovative city designers, tech experts and business development experts from local and int. companies such as ST Electronics, JTC, Jurong Consultants, Frost & Sullivan, IDA International, Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) etc., students will be familiarized with the opportunities and challenges of the  smart city business  which represents a key element in the value creation and extraction strategy of the Singapore Government and related businesses."
COR-MGMT2211,"Harnessing Robotics, UAVs, and Digital Innovation for Business","This course is a response to the increasing use of robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and digital technologies in business and society. Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War I when the US army experimented with unmanned aerial torpedos. Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations. Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various functionalities of robotics, UAVs and digital innovations in order to critically assess these technologies and to articulate informed opinions about  the good ,  the bad , and  the future  of these novel technological developments. The course will be taught by a multi-disciplinary team of instructors plus exposure to tech entrepreneurs and digital (corporate) innovation champions."

COR-OBHR1308,Transformative Leadership,"The core objective of the new SMU-X Transformative Leadership course is to nurture a new generation of young leaders motivated and capable of tackling intricate global and local challenges related to the nexus of  digital disruption, demographic change and diversity  in an integrated, interdisciplinary fashion, providing the opportunity to integrate perceived differences between older and younger people in terms of values, communication priorities; age discrimination or the initiation of new types of social ( digital ) behaviours transmitted from the plugged-in  Generation Z  (born 1996 and after) to Baby Boomers (born 1946 to 1964). These three challenges (positioned at the interface of both current and future issues) are not only globally relevant but also have significant local implications for Singapore.

Embedded in the experiential SMU-X initiative, the Transformative Leadership course provides students with a unique learning opportunity to develop and implement (socially) innovative solutions to make a positive impact on business and society in close collaboration with reputable partners in business, nonprofits and government. Learners will be paired up with an external SMU-X partner to work on relevant innovative projects with real impact.

The successful completion of such transformative SMU-X projects requires learners diving deep(er) into various disciplines such as social sciences, business, political governance, public policy, demography, technology, etc. It is expected that the chosen practical challenges commissioned by SMU-X partners will  stretch  students, forcing them to step out of their comfort zones and to explore the unknowns in order to make a  real  difference  out there  in both the social and business sectors.

In terms of effective leader development, in particular, transformative leadership, the SMU-X course design will support learners in expanding their individual capacity to be effective in leadership roles and processes. Emphasis will be put on proximal indicators of leader development such as self-views around self-concept, including leader self-awareness, leadership self-efficacy and leader. Through their SMU-X projects, students will appreciate the importance of leadership development so that they can articulate what it takes for teams and their leaders to create strong(er) alignment and high(er) levels of commitment. The latter requires interpersonal trust, care and concern as well as shared mind-sets regarding (transformative) goals and values such as the  real  sharing propelled by collaborative leadership approaches."
COR-PHIL2625,Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy,"This course will provide a detailed coverage of the most important works of classical Chinese philosophy from the Spring and Autumn period to the end of the Warring States Period, that is from roughly 722 until 221 BCE.

In the final part of the course we focus on specific issues and challenges, including the role of leaders, dynamics within political institutions, development, civil society, conflict and human rights, ASEAN, foreign policy and regional security. This course provides a valuable foundation for understanding Southeast Asia and is recommended for any student interested in learning about the region."
COR-PPPM1311,Collaborative Governance,"Contemporary governance illustrates a shift from a hierarchical, bureaucratic government to more collaborative, participative, and inclusive governance processes. Actors from public, private, and non-profit sectors collectively engage in policy decision-making to address complex social problems. Today's policy problems are described as  wicked problems  that lack a set of clear definitions, causes and effects, and solutions. The wicked nature of the policy problems requires considering the perspectives of multiple stakeholders and innovative policy solutions. This course explores how governments and their stakeholders have experimented with new ideas, policies, governing processes, institutional arrangements, management tools, and technologies, to create public value and effect positive change. Using cases studies from a variety of policy areas and different countries, the course encourages students to understand the opportunities and challenges of public sector change initiatives including collaborative governance, e-governance, and coproduction.

For SMU students in particular, the rising China will most likely enter your future careers and lives in some consequential ways. This course takes you beyond China s economic growth record, which everybody can find in news headlines. It situates China s economic growth in the whole-scale transformation of the Chinese society of which it is part and parcel to understand what made the economic miracle possible, what shapes its trajectory, and what threatens its sustainability. We will also learn a novel analytical framework that provides us an anchor point from which to observe the fast-changing Chinese society and to gauge the social impact of China s economic growth."
COR-SOCG2609,Global and Transnational Sociology," Globalization  is one of the most important concepts for understanding the nature of the contemporary world, where various connections and interdependencies continue to proliferate and intensify across national borders. Especially in Singapore, we live globalization on a daily basis; for example, the mixing of various cultures and peoples from the East and the West, and the growing business interests and financial investments from all over the world. Moreover, the postcolonial context of Singapore sheds light on historical connections between contemporary globalization and legacies of imperialism. Thus, Singapore is a  natural laboratory  for studying the trajectories and frontiers of globalization. In this course, we will examine both theories and case studies of globalization to understand changing realities of Singapore and the world at large."
COR-SOCG2637,Deconstructing Singapore Society,"Singapore is a fascinating subject of sociological inquiry. Constructing Singapore s history remains a struggle against competing notions of the state as a tool of British colonialism, an adjunct of Malaysia before its untimely expulsion, immigrants  lay-over and Lee Kuan Yew s political success. Since independence, Singapore s leaders lament its lacking natural resources to justify their  pragmatic  management of the everyday lives of Singaporeans, including speech, educational environment, sexuality, religious expressions, ethnic identity and political culture, at the expense of citizens  rights. Populated dominantly by ethnic Chinese with Malays and Indians as minorities, yet geographically surrounded by Muslim-majority nations have made the ruling PAP reluctant to observe multiracialism in governance policies which compromises the nation-building project. Presently, forces of globalisation threaten the state s monopoly over political space and ideologies. This module targets students interested in developing a critical appreciation of the socio-economic and political contexts that structure Singaporeans  daily lives. It highlights critical historical circumstances that shape Singapore s post-independent governance policies, political discourses and contemporary development as a nation-state. It sharpens students  sociological imagination as they deconstruct political ideologies to grasp alternative interpretations of the development of Singapore society and make sense of contemporary issues of importance in Singapore and to Singaporeans."

CS425,Natural Language Communication,"Natural Language Communication (NLC) is the convergence of a diverse set of human language technologies that enable computer systems to interact reasonably with people in a natural and human-like way. NLC requires considering human language as the central part of communicative channel, where the computer should be able to perform a series of language processing actions: 1) It should correctly process our written or spoken utterances as input in order to respond accordingly; 2) It should allow technology to understand complex sentences, which may contain multiple pieces of information and many turns of requests; 3) It can then react by reasoning and/or interrogating and synthesizing various data from third-party systems or external knowledge, and use that information in generating sensible responses. In this course, we will cover diverse fundamental methods and techniques across the themes of natural language processing, understanding and generation that are indispensable for constructing modern NLC systems.

With examples from domains such as transportation, economics, finance, and urban planning, we show how ABMS can help us better understand complex business and social phenomena. ABMS systems are particularly powerful if we want to describe a system populated by many independent and heterogeneous decision makers (who can be collaborators or competitors). ABMS systems can also be used in performing policy evaluations and generating decision supports, as we can then computationally test how changes in parameters at different levels would affect various performance indicators.

Besides covering theoretic foundations of ABMS, we focus heavily on hands-on learning as well. In particular, we will expose students to NetLogo, an intuitive yet powerful modeling language for building ABMS systems. We will be learning NetLogo by building several classical ABMS examples incrementally in class.

A well-developed financial system (comprising money, financial instruments, financial markets, financial institutions, government regulatory agencies and central banks) improves the efficiency of financing decisions, favouring a better allocation of resources and thereby economic growth. What is the underlying mechanism that explains the positive relationship between the degree of development of the financial system and economic development? How should elements of both direct, market-based and indirect, bank-based finance be incorporated? What are the comparative advantages of market vs bank-based finance? In cases where the industry faces strong information asymmetries, is bank-based financing an effective solution to adverse selection and moral hazard problems that exist between good and bad borrowers?

The course will begin with distinguishing between the concepts of growth and development and motivating the study of economic growth. The neo-classical growth model will be introduced as a framework for understanding how growth occurs. The course will then unpack the model part by part, both theoretically and empirically, for a more nuanced understanding of growth. Its ingredients such as human capital formation will be studied. Its assumption of perfect institutions will be examined with a particular focus on property rights, corruption, and financial development. The causal impact of institutions on growth will be explored. Finally growth theory will be revisited to see how poverty traps arise as a result of imperfect institutions leading to emergence and persistence of poor economic outcomes. The course will end with an introduction to political economy of development where we will explore reasons why inefficient policies are often chosen."

ECON208,Industrial Organisation,"This course introduces the modern theory of industrial organization, a branch of microeconomics. The field departs from assumptions of perfect competition and studies markets in which a small number of firms operate and can strategically influence their market s outcome. We begin with the study of monopolies and platforms and then focus largely on the forms and consequences of oligopolistic competition, including product differentiation, advertising / branding, entry and exit, mergers and collusion, etc. Throughout these topics we will weave in the basic tools of empirical industrial organization as we use these theories to explain real-world firm behavior and market outcomes. Please note the first half of the class serves as a more in-depth treatment of several topics from Microeconomics 2 (ECON251), but this course is self-contained and does not require ECON251."
ECON209,Labour Economics,"This course introduces theory, applications, and empirical evidence in a wide range of topics in modern labour economics. We start with the principles of supply and demand in a competitive labour market to evaluate the impact of the tax and transfer system, the minimum wage, the employment protection legislation, and immigration on wages and employment. We then consider monopsony, job amenities, human capital, labour mobility, discrimination, and incentive pay to understand the nature and causes of wage differentials. Throughout the course, we discuss many stylized facts of labour markets and some econometric methods for policy evaluation."
ECON210,Monetary Economics,"This course aims to strengthen our understanding of some of the most basic questions in monetary economics: How does money promote economic exchange? What should serve as money? What causes inflation? What is the cost of inflation? Our approach is to build the microeconomic foundations of monetary and other macroeconomic topics, that is, we seek to explain aggregate economic phenomena as the implications of the choices of rational individuals who aim to improve their welfare within their limited means. We begin our study with questions of the demand for fiat money, go on to introduce banking and financial intermediation, and finally look at the effects of money on saving, investment, and output."
ECON211,Public Sector Economics,"The module begins by revisiting the conceptual basis for the ""minimum"" role of a government in a free market economy and focuses attention on different types of market failure in which a wider role for the government could be considered. An appreciation for the potential scope of government failure is also developed here to allow for a more holistic approach when contemplating intervention. It then proceeds to discuss the economics underlying social transfer schemes and a variety of other public sector programs that falls outside the ambit of the so-called ""minimum"" role. Here, governmental expenditure programs such as programs on health care, social security and education come into focus. Finally, the module discusses the financing of government programs bringing into focus the taxation system. The efficiency and distributional effects of different taxes and their implication on the choice of financing method and on project evaluation are some of the issues that will be discussed here. An introduction to optimal taxation theory is also included here. From time to time, during the exposition of the module, reference will be made to the US experience and to the Singapore experience to provide the practical motivation underlying a number of the ideas covered."

ECON213,Environmental Economics,"In this course, conceptual and empirical tools in economics are employed to deepen the student s understanding of a variety of environmental issues. The conceptual tools derive mainly from the theory of externalities, public goods and property rights while the empirical tools involve techniques that will permit the economic valuation of various environmental attributes so as to permit a proper cost-benefit analysis of various programs. In the exposition, generic issues such as air pollution and water pollution will be discussed. Attention will also be given to a variety of local, bilateral and multilateral issues that are of direct relevance to Singapore including the allocation of scarce land resource to nature conservation, waste management and the management of air quality, the reclamation of land, and issues concerning global-warming.

  How to attract and motivate the right people to work for the firm? -- Incentives and employment in organizations;
  How to get things done in firms? -- Decision-making and implementation in organizations;
  Is the firm fulfilling its purpose? -- Evaluating the performance of organizations."
ECON220,Economic Growth,"The income per capita in the United States and Western Europe is around fifty times greater than in much of sub-Saharan Africa. This prompts the question: Why are some countries rich and others poor? From around 1870 until the Second World War, Japan s income per capita remained around 25 percent of U.S. income per capita. After the substantial reforms put in place at the end of the war, Japanese relative income rose sharply so that today Japanese standard of living is roughly two-thirds that of the U.S. level. The rapid catch-up was also achieved in the post-war period by several other Asian economies including Singapore. What is it that makes it possible for countries to produce growth miracles? For much of world history, people lived at subsistence levels well described by Thomas Malthus. Around the nineteenth century, however, there was an escape from Malthusian stagnation beginning in Europe. What is the engine of economic growth? Gasoline contributes to air pollution as it powers our cars. The release of carbon dioxide as oil and gasoline are burned contributes to global warming. What is the relationship between economic growth and environmental quality? These are the questions that we will pursue in this course."

Particular attention will be paid to the electric power, telecommunications and transport sectors.  Relevant cases from different countries will be used to highlight issues and provide a more complete understanding of the options and problems involved.  The second half of the course aims at giving students an introduction to the basic issues of competition policy: market power and market definition, cartels and tacit collusion, mergers and vertical restraints, and predatory practices."
ECON225,Health Systems and Policy,"This course will examine the diversity of healthcare systems around the world in terms of governance, provision, financing and ownership. Singapore s healthcare system and its evolution will be examined in depth to highlight the health promotion and healthcare philosophies and strategies. This course will also cover the trends in the causes of morbidity and how the demographic transition is likely to affect their relative importance and overall healthcare costs, particularly in a rapidly ageing society such as Singapore s. With respect to the issue of healthcare costs, matters of quality and efficiency of healthcare service delivery will be discussed."
ECON226,Urban Economics and Policy,"This course is designed as an introductory course of urban economics. It covers fundamental principles developed in economics to understand the functioning/workings of an urban economy and the various aspects of urban life. Firstly, the course begins with the definition of a city, and why cities form by introducing the economics of agglomeration, and how cities interact to form the urban system of the entire economy. These factors affect all urban phenomena. Secondly, the course analyzes the internal spatial structure of a city by developing a theory of commuting, housing demand and housing production. It then analyzes transportation and land/housing issues in more detail. On transportation, we focus on the economics of traffic congestions, the rationale for congestion pricing (ERP), and the so-called fundamental law of highway congestion. The discussion on land and housing, will address various housing phenomena such as tenure choice and location. The courses will discuss the optimality of local public good provision, and connect local public finance and housing markets with land taxation. Finally, the course addresses the economics of urban planning to comprehend various urban forms that are found in different cities in the world. It will highlight key aspects of Singapore s urban policies, such as the ERP and the Land Acquisition Act 1973. The topics for group projects cover many other urban policies in Singapore and its comparison with other countries, including but not limited to Singapore s master plans."
ECON228,Economic Analysis of Multinational Firms,"In recent years, the global economy has witnessed a sharp increase in multinational activity. This course explores this recent development from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, to provide insight into how economists analyze the causes and consequences of this rise in multinational activity. The first half of the course will take a careful look at the economic theories proposed to understand why some firms choose to go multinational, while also studying the empirical evidence that economists have brought to bear to test these theories. The second half of the class will focus on the potential effects of multinational activity in both source and host countries."
ECON229,The Economics of Asymmetric Information,"To explore how asymmetric information plays a crucial role in different areas of economic life, to understand its effect on different markets and contractual relationships, and to investigate solutions to the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection.  Tools used include basic game theory and calculus.  A high degree of student involvement is a major objective, so student presentations of assigned readings and detailed peer discussions will feature prominently."
ECON230,Urban Economics and Real Estate,"This course is intended for students who wish to gain better understanding of the economics of urban growth and real estate markets; infrastructure and real estate financing; public controls and policies.  It considers the interactions between private action and public policy and regulation--including land use policy, taxation, and housing policies. Finally, the links between local housing and related markets--such as urban transportation and public finance--will be explored."
ECON231,Economic Aspects of Maritime Law,"The carriage of goods by sea was one of the very earliest forms of commercial activity, as is shown by ancient examples of Greek and Roman art. ""Carriage"" remains to this day one of the most challenging and lucrative areas of legal practice: the sums of money in dispute are frequently such that parties and their legal advisers are happy to extend fundamental principles of commercial law to their limit - and beyond. English law enjoys considerable pre-eminence in the law of Carriage and ship owners, charterers and traders round the world frequently conclude contracts of carriage on the basis of English law with disputes resolved through London arbitration and litigation.

A practical approach to study carriage contracts is adopted through the eyes of the Maritime Economist and the Shipping Professional, starting from buying or building a ship, financing it, the fixing or booking of the contract, the provision of the vessel, the shipping of the goods, the issue of bills of lading or other shipping documents, the voyage, discharge of the goods and remedies. Shipping Professionals such as Maritime lawyers, P&I Claims Handlers and Ship Operators are brought in class to share their views and experiences and prepare the students for the real world challenges ahead in the Shipping Industry."
ECON233,Economic Forecasting,"Forecasting is a fundamental activity of all participants in a modern economy. Policy makers and businesses rely on macroeconomic forecasts when making decisions. Firms rely on forecasts of economic conditions, sales, input prices, etc., to guide production decisions. Participants in financial markets (investors, speculators, risk managers) all act on forecasts of asset returns and volatility.

This course covers the elements of economic forecasting. We cover both methods for generating economic forecasts, as well as for evaluating forecasts. The methods discussed are primarily ARMA and regression-based models, although some nonlinear techniques are also discussed. We will also discuss practical issues such as producing and evaluating multi-step ahead forecasts, dealing with misspecification, and using mixed frequency data.

The course is application-oriented. Participants in this course will work with actual data in realistic forecasting scenarios. We will use econometric software in applications, but no programming skill is required."
ECON234,International Trade,"This course examines the economic determinants of cross-country trade patterns and welfare properties of trade policies. We first introduce economic models that focus on cross-country differences (in technology, in factor endowment), imperfect competition, or increasing returns to scale as the rationale for trade and the consequences of opening to trade on national welfare and on income distribution within and across countries. We then examine the economic causes and effects of increasing trade in intermediate goods or services through international outsourcing and foreign direct investment. In the third component of the course, we examine efficiency properties of frequently used trade measures, the political economy of trade protection, and welfare effects of preferential trade liberalizations such as free trade agreements against the backdrop of multilateral trade liberalizations sponsored by the WTO.

Economics first major students who do this course must do International Macroeconomics as well to replace International Economics."
ECON235,International Macroeconomics,"This course will cover basic concepts, tools and facts needed to understand the functioning of the global economy and international financial markets. We develop a theoretical framework for the analysis of the determinants of current account deficits, international capital movements, real and nominal exchange rates. We also examine the relationship between interest rates and exchange rates, and discuss various measures of global capital market integration. This framework is then used to discuss relevant policy issues such as the emergence of the US as a foreign debtor, the developing country external debt crises and balance-of-payment crises.

Economics first major students who do this course must do International Trade as well to replace International Economics."

Students will work on projects to examine parental choice of primary school, interaction of youths across socioeconomic groups, work-family balance, coping strategies of the sandwiched generation, impact on and responses by families and the government to an aging population, and impact of changing social attitudes on families. Specific topics will be incorporated or will even replace some of the above given the experiential nature of the course; in fact, the topics to be investigated as group projects will be jointly formulated by the students, the faculty, and the partners based on issues and problems they are facing currently."
ECON241,Strategic Thinking,"This course provides rigorous analyses on (1) how intelligent agents, when participating in interactive activities, make choices anticipating the behavior of other intelligent agents, and (2) how a social planner can design rules and institutions to achieve desirable social outcomes, taking into account sophisticated reactions of intelligent agents. Tools in both cooperative and non-cooperative game theories are introduced. More focus is given to applications in political, legal, and economic issues, e.g., choices of voting rules, marriage market, kidney exchange, accident law, and etc."
ECON242,Political Economy Analysis of Institutions,"This course aims to provide a broad analytical framework for understanding the evolution of major public institutions in modern society. Frontier research findings will be introduced covering topics such as the evolution process of political regime from monarchy to democracy, how democratization interacts with development, how the legal protection of property rights is affected by political power and economic structure, why contract enforcement in some countries rely more on relations while in others on the legal system, why the education system is more centralized in some countries than others, and how they may affect innovation, corporate governance, and middle income trap. Issues related to war, colonization, and global order may also be discussed depending on interests.

ECON248,Overseas Project Experience (Macroeconomics in Asia),"Financial Markets play an important part in assuring the efficiency of the economy, creating economic growth and development for many countries. However, we are also experiencing more and more economic turbulence erupts from the activities of financial markets which raising questions regarding the essential roles of the Central Bank especially in conducting Monetary Policy as well as managing the banking system and financial markets.

There are two main parts to this course. The first part explains the functions and structure of Financial Markets, helping students to understand the meaning and behavior of interest rates. That serves as the background for the second part, in which money and monetary policy theory and strategies will be introduced. Both parts will highlight the management roles of the Central Bank.

This is an SMU-XO course hence students will have a chance to work on real-world projects faced by the Central Bank of Vietnam, related to the conduct of monetary policy and/or the management of financial markets in Vietnam.

In addition, students will learn the tools to deal with decisions under risk and how asymmetries of information affect economic institutions. Finally, students are introduced the basic concept from Game Theory, which provides a rigorous treatment of strategic decision making. During the course, the applicability of these concepts to practical situations and their linkages to various economic electives will be discussed."
ECON252,Macroeconomics 2,"This course is the second part of a two-course Macroeconomics sequence. The aim of the sequence is twofold. First, it is to introduce students to modern macroeconomic theory, in particular formal macroeconomic models built on microfoundations. Second, it is to develop a deep understanding of macroeconomic phenomena such as business cycles, long-term economic growth, and the process of economic development, as well as macroeconomic policy issues, such as the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on the economy and the design of a social security system or an unemployment insurance scheme.
This second part of the sequence first reviews the topics of consumption and savings, investment, and the labor market covered in ECON 112 (Macroeconomics 1) and enriches the analysis by considering the impact on consumption and investment decisions of (a) imperfections of the financial sector, for instance leading to the existence of credit constraints, (b) uncertainty, and (c) adjustment costs, as well as by introducing the flow approach to the labor market and using the search and matching framework to understand labor market data and policies. The course then introduces the notion of money and considers the role of financial intermediaries, which are then used to study the long-term impact of monetary policy as well as the role of banking supervision and macro-prudential regulation. The course finally studies business cycles and covers the measurement of cycles, reviews the main existing theories and their policy prescriptions, with a particular emphasis being put on severe recessions or depressions."

ECON655,Managerial Economics,"This course covers the basic Microeconomic principles that are at the heart of managerial decision-making. These principles are taught inductively starting from simple examples and practical problems.

Microeconomics is about allocating scarce resources among alternative uses. Microeconomics is also a theory of incentives, intended as the set of rules within which people behave. Policy making (what managers might be in charge of, and surely subjected to) is intended as actions changing the incentives.

In this course attention will be paid on how individuals make decisions (first aspect of Microeconomics) and how incentives are effective in obtaining the desired outcomes (second aspect of Microeconomics). These two aspects combined together provide ample learning scope for managerial decision making.

As stated, learning is via examples and problem solving. Applications concern, mostly, pricing strategies under different settings, cost optimization, negotiations and competitive bidding, governance and agency problems, corporate and social responsibility."

ECON672,Global Economics,"This course provides a broad but rigorous look at the international aspects of economics. The course is divided into two sections: the microeconomic section with a focus on trade, and the macroeconomic section with a focus on the international finance aspects. The trade section establishes the foundations of comparative advantages and the benefits of trade and assesses the issues of international policy concerning trade, including current contentions and controversies. The second section broadens the horizons to include international payments and flows of money, the issue of surpluses and deficits and international policy concerning exchange rate and monetary regimes."
ECON675,Managerial Economics,"The economic environment provides many of the critical parameters for companies doing business in an increasingly integrated world. Economic expansion or recession will change all business forecasts; market structure will affect profitability; fluctuating exchange rates will have an impact on costs, sales, risk perceptions and debt levels; and the state of the national budget or interest-rate decisions can color a company  s future. In particular, a global recession like the one suffered recently can transform consumption behavior and business strategies. Managerial Economics provides students with a framework to understand the main economic variables and dynamics that affect business activity. Understanding the microeconomy is the first stepping-stone toward achieving a full grasp of the economic world that surrounds us. Most of the world  s countries rely on free markets to make most of their economic decisions, and those markets automatically answer the key economic questions (What will we produce? How will we produce it? At what price? Who will get it?) through the operation of supply and demand. The course will review the basic concepts of supply, demand, market failures and externalities to provide a broad perspective on how free markets work. It will then move on to elasticity and market structures and their impact on profitability. The objective is to give students a firm understanding of how supply and demand at the micro-level determine the basic parameters of doing business. Yet markets are not perfect. In our times, a period of deregulation and strong faith in markets to solve economic problems has been followed by the deepest economic crisis since the early 20th century, with devastating effects on output, income and employment nearly everywhere. The experience has brought back to the fore the key questions of how economic decisions should be made, and how much governments should intervene when market failures exist, especially in light of pressing problems such as environmental deterioration which the market appears poorly equipped to solve. The second part of the course will focus on the macroeconomy and the policies that governments follow, and how the interaction between free economic forces and policy affect the business cycle and company prospects. It will begin by analyzing the key macroeconomic indicators --GDP, inflation and unemployment and the business cycle--, and evaluate how changes in these variables affect businesses. It will then outline the dynamics of the macroeconomy, the operation of fiscal and monetary policies and how and why policy decisions are made, to give students the tools to anticipate key policy decisions and understand their impact on the macroeconomy. Finally, the course moves from the micro and national levels to the global level, for a look at international trade, exchange rates and the balance of payments. It will detail the forces of trade, the determinants of exchange rates, and the important concepts underlying the balance of payments; and how all of those elements of the international economy affect business. In the process, we will encounter an explanation for the Great Contraction that occurred beginning in 2008, and will be able to understand how the crisis has and will change our economic lives. A special focus will be given to the Asian markets to see their dynamics."
ECON676,Economic Analysis,"This is an intensive course aims to equip students with the basic knowledge and skills to understand and analyze economic issues. It is about understanding how the (economic) world works   the big picture and the fine detail   and how the actions of individuals, corporations and governments play out at the microeconomic, macroeconomic and international economic levels.

In microeconomics, we study the principles used to describe the marketplace behaviour of consumers and firms, and the characteristics of different types of product markets. Is the demand curve for a product always downward-sloping (i.e. inverse relation between price and quantity)? Where does a firm s supply curve come from? What affects the slopes of the demand and supply curves (i.e. price
elasticities of demand and supply)? How does a firm price its product in a competitive market, in a market with a few sellers, or if the firm is the only seller in the market (i.e. monopolist)? Should firms practice price discrimination? These are some of the questions we will discuss in this section of the course.

In macroeconomics, we study the fundamental concepts of national output and income measurement, aggregate demand and supply analysis, and the analysis of the factors affecting economic growth. We discuss monetary and fiscal policies and how they are used by central banks and governments to mitigate the severity of economic fluctuations and to achieve other policy goals. What is quantitative
easing and how is it different from conventional monetary policy? Why do central banks impose negative interest rates and how does it work? Are central banks running  out of ammo  to combat the global economic slowdown? Is there a role for fiscal policy? These are among some of the current issues we will discuss in this section of the course.

In international economics, we study the economy in a global context, i.e. the flows of goods and services, physical capital, and financial capital across national borders; and discuss the role of exchange rates in international trade and how exchange rates are determined. Why do countries trade? Why do some countries export cars, and some other countries export hospital services? How did agricultural subsidies lead to  rice mountain  in Thailand, and  butter mountain  and  wine lake  in Europe? Why is the perennial debt ceiling problem in the US of concern to the rest of the world? Without its own currency, how will Greece recover from its sovereign debt crisis? These are among some of the topical issues we will explore in this section of the course."

First, methods for the implementation of Markowitz `optimal  portfolios, and how to best implement such portfolios in practice. Second, multiple testing procedures: when many hypothesis tests are carried out at the same time (such as when evaluating the performance of a large number of fund managers), one needs to take the multiplicity into account in order to safeguard against the possibility of making false rejections / discoveries beyond the pre-specified significance level. Many such procedures exist, though not all well understood. Students will learn which procedures to use for which purposes. Third, we discuss performance hypothesis testing (such as for the equality of Sharpe ratios of two investment strategies) in the absence of strong and unrealistic parametric assumptions on financial data."

The first part introduces the positive theories of trade: including the classical models of trade (that focus on comparative advantage as the source of gains from trade), the new trade theories (that rely on imperfect competition and/or increasing returns to scale as the rationale for trade), and the new-new trade theories (that incorporate firm heterogeneity in predicting the trade structure). This is followed by a review of the theories of outsourcing and foreign direct investment that focus on the trade in intermediate goods and services. The second part introduces the normative theories of trade and evaluates the welfare properties of international trade policies. Topics discussed include the political economy of trade protection, the mechanism design of multilateral trade agreements (GATT/WTO), and the welfare effects of preferential trade agreements."

The first part of the course will focus on the complete information model and study Nash implementation. The second part will focus on incomplete information environments and study dominant strategy implementable social choice functions in various restricted domain settings which include models with quasi-linear utilities and auction settings. The course will study both deterministic and random social choice functions.
ECON726,Panel Data Econometrics I,"Panel data econometrics is one of the most exciting and fruitful fields in modern econometrics. This course serves as a solid introduction to panel data analysis. We will first introduce static panel data models where we learn basic techniques to handle panel data with random or fixed effects, to distinguish between random and fixed effects panel data models, and test for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity in panel data models. Then we introduce dynamic panel data models where we discuss both GMM and maximum likelihood estimation. We will also introduce panel data models with variable coefficients where the coefficients can change over either the cross section or time dimensions, or both, review various tests of structural breaks in panel data models, and study panel data models with latent structures. More advanced topics such as panel data models with cross sectional dependence, nonstationary panels, nonlinear panels, and nonparametric/semiparametric panels will be covered in Panel Data Econometrics I."
ECON727,Panel Data Econometrics II,"This is a subsequent course of Panel Data Econometrics I. We will focus on various special and advanced topics in panel data analysis. We first study factor models that can be used to handle both micro and large dimensional macro/financial data sets, one of the most popular ways to introduce strong cross-sectional dependence in the model and to extract information from a big data set. Next, we introduce spatial panel data models which use spatial weights as an alternative way to model weak cross-sectional dependence. Then we study various modern techniques to test for panel unit root and cointegration with or without cross-sectional dependence and to make inference in panel cointegrating models. We also study various nonlinear panel data models that include binary choice models, censored models, and truncated models. Lastly, we study various nonparametric and semiparametric panel data models with or without cross-sectional dependence."
ECON728,Mechanism Design II,"The course is the second part of a two module sequence on mechanism design and will study selected topics in the theory of mechanism design. It requires students to have taken an earlier module, Econ 725, which is an introduction to the theory of implementation and mechanism design. The first part of this course will focus on the optimal auction design problem. The second part of the course will examine recent developments in the theory of multidimensional mechanism design. If time permits, the module will briefly touch upon problems in dynamic mechanism design."

Poverty, inequality, credits, health, education, and labor are the main topics covered in this course."
ECON731,Social Interactions,This course will survey recent work in economics on social interactions. Research on social interactions represents an effort to integrate sociological ideas into economics while preserving the core logic of economic reasoning. The course will cover both theoretical models of social interactions as well as issues in econometric identification of these models. Topics will include social networks and neighborhood formation.
ECON732,Advanced Mathematical Economics,"The course covers 6 topics in mathematical economics, utilizing the separation theorem of convex sets and the fixed point theorem.  The topics include the classical ones such as the theory of core and the fundamental theorem of welfare economics, and the recent issues such as equilibrium existence problem for games with discontinuous payoffs."
ECON733,Industrial Organisation II,This course introduces the modern theoretical and empirical of industrial organization. We depart from the  competitive market  assumption and study oligopolistic markets in which a small number of firms operate and strategically influence the market outcome. Attention to the regulation of real-world competition distinguishes this course from related courses of Microeconomics and Game Theory.
ECON734,Spatial Econometrics,"Spatial dependence or social interaction among the geographical units, economic agents or social actors, such as neighbourhood effects, copy-catting, and peer effects, has received increased attention by regional scientists, economists, econometricians, and statisticians. In the broad field of economics, there is a growing recognition that standard econometric techniques often fails in the presence of spatial interactions. As a result, spatial econometric models and methods have been applied not only in specialized fields such as regional science, urban economics, real estate and economic geography, but also increasingly in more traditional fields of economics as well, including demand analysis, labour economics, public economics, international economics, and agricultural and environmental economics.

This course introduces common spatial econometric models, including spatial regression models, spatial panel data models, and spatial dynamic panel data models, where the spatial dependence is built into the model in the form of spatial error dependence, or spatial lag dependence, or both. For each model, common inference methods, such as quasi-maximum likelihood and GMM, are introduced, and empirical illustrations presented. If time permits, recent advances on refined and robust inferences methods will be discussed."
ECON735,Advances in the Singapore and ASEAN Economies,"Singapore became independent on 9 August 1965. Its per capita income was only about US$500, about the same as Mexico and S. Africa then. By 2015, its per capita income was US$56,000, similar to Germany and the US. Its economic journey began with its dependence on entrepot trade and heavy dependence on the expenditure of British bases. Today it is a global city state: a little red dot, but a global brand.

Singapore is ranked by the World Bank as the easiest place in the world to do business and by the Heritage Foundation and the freest economy in the world, after Hong Kong. There are virtually no import tariffs, no export subsidies, no exchange restrictions, no price ceilings, no minimum wage, no rent control. Income tax rates are among the lowest in the world, and government expenditure as a percentage of GDP well below most countries.

Singapore s leadership over the last 50 years can best be described as innovative and entrepreneurial in their policy making. Like China, careful choice and grooming of political leaders plus an orderly succession have provided the political stability and confidence for investors, resulting in rising standards of living.

Singapore s policy approach is both pragmatic   an emphasis on what works in practice rather than abstract theory; and eclectic   a willingness to adopt best practices from around the world. Market principles and signals guide its policies such as industrial policy, medical insurance, congestion pricing, social security, regulation of utilities, or allocation of land. Nevertheless, its Government does not hesitate to intervene when markets fail. State-owned enterprises continue to exist and thrive but they are run on market principles and are not allowed endless State subsidies.

Welfare programs exist but are minimal so that work incentives are not eroded. Housing, health and education are subsidized.

Going forward, Singapore faces substantial challenges: a rapidly aging population, the political necessity to limit immigrant workers, declining exports and productivity, loss of competitiveness and inequality. Its leaders are searching for a new paradigm of growth."

ECON744,Topics in Health Economics,"Health economics is a rapidly growing and increasingly popular field in economics. This course will survey recent work in health economics. The course will mainly cover evidence-based empirical research using recent econometric tools such as regression discontinuity design and randomized controlled trials. Topics include demand and supply of healthcare services, economic returns to medical care, economic issues in health insurance reforms, long-term effects of early-life health shocks, health care in developing countries, etc. There will be individual presentations of published research articles or their own, preliminary research ideas by students."
ECON745,Topics in Labour Economics,"In the first part of the course, we will cover major topics in labor economics, including labor supply and human capital theory. Specifically, we will study life-cycle models of consumption, labor supply, and human capital accumulation. We will also discuss the estimation of the life-cycle models, focusing on practical methods for estimating dynamic discrete choice models and their application.

In the second part of the course, we will cover recent developments in the field. I will present a review of each topic for the first part of each class, and a student will present a recent paper on the topic in the second part. I will post the topics to be covered and the papers to be presented later. We will discuss all the aspects of the article: its contribution, limitation, possible extension, and application to other fields."
ECON746,High Frequency Econometrics,The course covers some topics on the frontier of high-frequency econometrics. Both theoretical and applied aspects will be discussed.
ECON747,Spatial Econometric Models and Methods,"Spatial econometrics consists of econometric techniques dealing with empirical problems (in regional science, economics, and social sciences) where  interactions  among geographical units, economic agents or social actors generate  spatial dependence  among cross-section units rendering classical econometric techniques invalid. Common spatial effects such as, neighbourhood effects, spillover effects, copy-catting, networks effects, and externalities, have received an increasing attention by applied researchers. Spatial econometric models and methods have been proved to be very effective tools in dealing with these issues. Applications are seen not only in specialized fields of regional science, urban economics, real estate and economic geography, but also increasingly in more traditional fields of economics and finance, including demand analysis, labour economics, public economics, international economics, agricultural and environmental economics, asset pricing model, and arbitrage pricing theory.

Spatial econometric models extend classical econometric models by incorporating spatial lag, spatial error, and/or spatial Durbin terms to capture spatial dependence through spatial weight matrices and spatial coefficients. This course introduces the core set of spatial econometric models including spatial linear regression models, spatial panel data models, and spatial dynamic panel data models, and the associated methods of estimation and inference such as (quasi) maximum likelihood, M-estimation, and GMM. Common tests for spatial and/or dynamic effects, e.g., LM tests, standardized LM tests, and bootstrap LM tests are introduced. Empirical illustrations of the methods are presented using Matlab software."
ECON748,Real Estate Economics,"This course provides an overview of real estate markets as well as public policies that affect those markets. We will discuss factors driving housing demand and supply, house price movements (captured by house price indices), and real estate cycles (including bubbles). We will also discuss different types of mortgage instruments used to finance investments in real estate and their impact on market outcomes. We unfold some of those topics in the context of the Great Recession in the U.S. and discuss potential implications for the global market. We will also touch on the impact of COVID-19 on the real estate market."
ECON749,Topics in Public Policy,"Public policy is concerned with improving economic and social welfare. It is usually the end point of many research investigations in multiple fields. Modern public policy tightly integrates theory with empirical evidence to derive quantitative predictions. This course will discuss household decision making and asymmetric information models as well as estimation and experimental methods to evaluate and design public and social policies. Practical motivation will be provided from recent demographic and economic shifts on top of discussion of seminal and recent literature.

The syllabus will address three broad policy issues:
  Population policies: Marriage and investments in children.
  Labor market policies: Education investments and labor market incentives.
  Social insurance policies: Sustaining and caring for the aged."
ECON750,Advanced Topics in Monetary Economics,"This is a course on modern monetary economics, with an emphasis on the theoretical foundations of money and liquidity. Tentative topics include:

ECON751,Topics in Financial Econometrics,The aim of this course is to enhance the understanding of some of econometric methods and models used in financial econometrics. The courses is en extension to the discrete time series methods and models covered in Econometrics II (623).
ECON6001,Time Series Econometrics,"This course covers models used in the econometric analysis and forecasting of economic time series, particularly macroeconomic time series data. The models covered include stationary and non-stationary autoregressive moving average models, autoregressive distributed lag models, error correction models, vector
autoregressions, and vector error correction models. Topics include correct inference and interpretation of model parameters, model selection, structural change, and forecasting, forecast uncertainty, and forecast evaluation. Implementation will use the R software."
ECON6002,Panel Data and Spatial Econometrics,"This course consists of two parts: Panel Data Analysis (Part I) and Spatial Econometrics (Part II).

Part I covers models and methods for analyzing panel and longitudinal data that arise from repeated measurements taken from a cross-section of subjects. These models have found substantive applications in social and biological sciences where the describer  panel  and  longitudinal  respectively arose. This course is primarily oriented to applications in social sciences including business, economics, education, sociology, etc. Major topics include (i) panel data models with individual-specific effects (fixed, random, or correlated random); (ii) panel data models with both individual- and time-specific effects, (iii) panel data models with heteroskedasticity and serial correlation, (iv) tests of hypotheses with panel data models, and (v) dynamic panel data models. Major inference methods such as (quasi) likelihood and GMM will be introduced. Throughout, we emphasize on models, methods and their applications with computer software STATA or R software.

Part II covers models and methods for analyzing spatial data or spatial panel data. The term  spatial  comes from the fact that cross-sectional (spatial) dependence exists among the spatial units so that the regular econometric methods are no longer valid for analyzing these data. Spatial dependence (or social interaction or network effect) often exists among economic agents (or geographical units or social actors), in the forms of neighbourhood effects, peer effects, copy-catting, and externalities. It has received an increasing attention by regional scientists, urban economists, econometricians, statisticians, etc. Spatial econometric models and methods have been proved to be effective tools in dealing with issues related to spatial dependence. Applications are seen not only in specialized fields of regional science, urban economics, real estate and economic geography, but also increasingly in more traditional fields of economics and finance, including demand analysis, labour, public, international, agricultural and environmental, asset pricing, and arbitrage pricing.

Major topics in this part includes (i) spatial linear regression models, (ii) spatial panel data models, (iii) spatial models with unknown heteroskedasticity, (iv) spatial dynamic panel data models, and (v) tests for spatial and/or dynamic effects in the spatial (dynamic) panel data models. In each type of spatial models, the spatial lag, spatial error, or spatial Durbin terms are used to model the endogenous
spatial effects, contextual effects, and spatial error dependence. Common estimation and inference methods such as (quasi) maximum likelihood and GMM, and common tests such as LM tests, are introduced. Empirical illustrations are presented using Matlab or R software."
ECON6003,International Trade: Theory and Policy,"This course in international trade covers theories of international trade and multinational production as well as trade policy. Key questions as we discuss theories of international trade are: Why do countries trade? What determines the pattern of international trade? What are the effects of international trade on income distribution? With these questions in mind, the course takes you through the classical models of trade that focus on cross-country differences as the source of gains from trade, the new trade theories that rely on imperfect competition and increasing returns to scale as the rationale for trade, and the recent models of multinational production with global sourcing of inputs.

The course continues with the welfare analysis of trade policy tools such as tariffs, quotas, and export subsidies. We compare the role of import quotas and tariffs under perfect competition and imperfect competition and study the role of strategic trade policy for international oligopolies. We study the political economy of trade protection as well as trade liberalization both at the multilateral level under the World Trade Organization (WTO) and at the bilateral/regional level. Examples of current debates in international trade that we analyze in-depth are the recent US-China trade war and the current global competition for market access in high-tech industries."
ECON6004,Econometric Methods for Programme Evaluation,"This course equips students with practical knowledge for the empirical analysis of micro data, building upon the theoretical foundations laid out in previous econometrics courses. Upon completion, students will be comfortable doing empirical work. We will cover a set of regression-based empirical tools useful for answering policy questions of interest to researchers, firms, and governments. These include linear regression, instrumental variable, and difference-in-difference. Students interested in applied microeconomics (e.g. labour, development, health, public, urban) and conducting impact evaluation research are encouraged to take this course.
Prior knowledge of basic and applied econometric techniques is required."
ECON6005,The Singapore Economy: Historical Development and Present Challenges,"The course introduces students to the historical and contemporary Singapore economy, as well as the current challenges confronting it. It begins by first tracing its historical development during the colonial era, which provides the context for the period of strong growth in the post-independence era. A
detailed study of the evolution of Singapore s modern economic growth and structure follows, covering trade, investment, labour market and business cycle developments. The final part of the course focuses on issues of economic policy as well as the future of the Singapore economy."
ECON6006,Financial Econometrics,"The application of econometric methods to the characterization of financial data, and to the estimation and testing of selected models of modern finance theory. Areas to be covered include: the statistical modelling and forecasting of financial time series, with application to share prices, exchange rates and interest rates; the specification, estimation and testing of asset pricing models including the capital asset pricing model and extensions; the modelling of volatility; practical application of volatility forecasting."
ECON6008,Machine Learning in Economics and Finance,"This course provides an overview of Machine Learning (ML) principals. The goal of the course is to teach you the basics of the ML theory and practice of ML algorithms. The course will build upon the knowledge and skills you gained in econometrics and statistics courses. Students will learn how to interpret, design, and execute empirical projects using software and skill building in critical thinking and problem solving will also be emphasized. We will additionally explain important issues and topics that recently happened in the ML literature."
ECON6009,Statistical Inference,"Statistics abounds in our everyday lives, from economics to physics, accountancy to medicine, business to technology, geography to law, social science to politics, a veritable all-embracing giant. No discipline does well that disavows it or belittles it. Though many occupations may not require specialized statistics degrees, they demand at least a working application of statistics, and able competency with data crunching, statistical software and results management."
ECON6011,"Money, Banking and International Finance","This course aims to provide students with an understanding of how the global monetary and financial system works. It provides a framework for analyzing issues that arise from the dynamic interaction between money, capital flows and financial sector activities. It examines how financial markets could fail, resulting in various types of financial crisis; and the roles central banks and financial institutions play in managing such crises. Specifically, the course covers topics such as the conduct of monetary policy, the operations of the banking system, capital flows and exchange rates, issues related to global imbalance, currency and financial crises, evolution of global monetary system and the reforms of the global financial system etc."
ECON6012,"Environmental Economics, Business and Policy","This course aims to help students understand the issues on environmental policies and business, and equip them with rigorous economics methods to analyze both domestic and international environmental issues.

Topics covered include welfare economic foundations, environmental policy instruments, environmental valuation, environment and development, as well as environmental accounting and business."
ECON6013,"Politics, Institutions and Economics","This course attempts to unpack the interplay between political, institutional, and cultural outcomes and deep economic forces such as incentives and technology. The course aims to show how we can make headway into understanding these phenomena using the empirical toolkit of an economist. The approach is empirical: We will study real-world patterns instead of grand theories; employ statistical methods instead of narratives or case studies; use events, laws, and the incentives they create to explain contemporary outcomes. The topics include how laws shape incentives and behaviour, how economic incentives shape political outcomes, and the interplay between economic forces and religion. The course content will rely entirely on papers rather a text book."
ECON6014,Advanced Microeconomic Analysis,"The course will initially study the fundamentals of contract design under asymmetric information. Problems of moral hazard, adverse selection, screening and signaling will be considered. The course will subsequently study the foundations of collective decision making from the standpoint of a policy maker. We will introduce the concepts of social preferences and aggregation and analyze their role in collective decision making. Finally, we will address a fundamental feature of economic systems, namely that agents have private information which must be elicited from them by the planner via appropriate incentive schemes. This part of the course provides a brief overview of the fields of implementation and mechanism design. Applications to situations of voting, public goods provision and auctions will be considered here."
ECON6015,Behavioral Economics,"This course will introduce the principles and applications of behavioral economics, with a focus on practical applications and real-world examples.

Material will cover deviations from the standard neoclassical model in terms of (i) preferences (time and risk preferences, reference dependence, and social preferences), (ii) beliefs and learning, and (iii) decision-making. The course will also provide insight into the practical application these findings to topics in management, finance, health and social policy (with an approximately equal focus on each throughout the course).

Grading will be based on class participation, group assignments, and a final exam."
ECON6016,Principles of Economics 1,"This course is divided into two main branches namely microeconomics and macroeconomics. While macroeconomics is concerned with the economy as a whole, microeconomics examines the individual parts of the economy and focuses on how individuals and firms make decisions and how these decisions interact. This course is designed to introduce learners to the fundamentals of economics by exposing them to the principal theories and models used by economists. It demonstrates how economics can be used by individuals and businesses alike to assess problems and develop solutions. It also examines the wider macroeconomic environment and the principles underlying monetary, fiscal policy and international trade."
ECON6017,Empirical Industrial Economics,"Industrial Economics/ Industrial Organization studies the behavior of firms and the operation of markets. Typical questions of Industrial Organizations are: What are the reasons for different market structures, such as the number of the market participants, or the offered product variety? Further, what determines firms  profitability or productivity? Many of the questions evaluate the effects of public policy on competition and consumer welfare.

In empirical Industrial Organization, such questions are addressed by focusing on one industry and usage of appropriate data as well as econometric tools. This course introduces the main models and tools. Empirical methods include reduced form methods with a focus on establishing causal effects, as well as empirical methods that build on theoretical assumption. We work hands-on with estimating demand functions and modeling competition. Further, we evaluate counterfactuals. Note that the course involves econometrics and coding.

Note that empirical tools of Industrial Organization are in high demand in the private and academic sector. Market regulators, antitrust- and marketing-consultancies, as well as competition authorities, are using econometric methods frequently. Furthermore, methods of industrial organization are actively used in academic and policy research."
ECON6018,Math for Economics,"This course introduces students to the rigorous mathematical foundations of economics. It offers students the necessary tools upon which modern economic analysis and modeling is based. This course emphasizes training in mathematics used in economics through the many economic applications in which mathematical tools are needed.

The course covers four main topics. The first part covers the basics, such as functions and set theory. The second part teaches matrix algebra in relations to equilibrium analysis, while the third part introduces the concept of comparative statics and the tools needed, derivatives. The fourth topic again uses derivatives to do a rigorous exposition on the most important skill in economics: optimization. In each part, there will be many economic applications to let students familiarize with the mathematical concepts in an economic context and learn their real-world usefulness."
ECON6019,Principles of Economics 2,"This course continues from Principles of Economics 1 to cover government interventions in markets, consumer demands, firms and market structures in the first part.

The second part of the course introduces students to the basic micro-foundations of macroeconomics, namely the consumption-leisure and consumption-saving trade-offs. The third part of the course covers the foundational theories of macroeconomics: the classical and Keynesian theories."
ECON6020,Further Math for Economics,"This course trains students in the rigorous mathematical foundations of economics. It offers students the necessary tools upon which modern economic analysis and modeling is based. This course emphasizes training in mathematics used in economics through the many economic applications in which mathematical tools are needed.

The course continues from ECON6018 by first covering the important techniques of constrained optimization. The second part extends the topics of matrix algebra to include further topics of linear algebra. The third part deals with integral analysis and probability theory. In each part, there will be many economic applications to let students familiarize with the mathematical concepts in an economic context and learn their real-world usefulness."
ECON6021,Infrastructure Economics and Policy,"This course will provide students with an understanding of the theory and practice of the economics of infrastructure provision, regulation, and policy. The first section of the course will deal with reform and governance in the infrastructure sectors and the rationale for privatization and public-private partnerships. The theoretical component will cover the rationale for economic regulation, the choice of regulatory instruments, pricing and subsidies, and design of markets and regulatory institutions for effective implementation. The analysis of these issues will be applied to several infrastructure sectors including water, telecommunications and the Internet, transportation, and electricity. The infrastructure sector is increasingly prominent on the sustainability agenda as the world confronts the urgent need to mitigate climate change. Relevant case studies will also be used to illustrate the application of economic principles to policy in specific sectors and contexts."
ECON6022,"Economics of Growth, Poverty and Inequality","This course provides an overview of how economists understand economic growth and the economics of poverty and inequality. The first part of the course discusses the main factors determining economic growth and how this assessment has changed over time. It covers key data and the main theories about economic growth, special factors affecting growth, and country experience with growth, focusing on Singapore. The second part presents data on inequality and poverty, including a discussion of various poverty and inequality measures and indices; factors explaining the causes of poverty and economic inequality; the relationship among growth, poverty, and inequality; the impact of ethnic and sexual discrimination on poverty and inequality; country experience with poverty and inequality, with a focus on Singapore and the United States; and strategies for addressing poverty and economic inequality."
ECON6023,Macroeconomic Accounts and Public Finance,"This course combines a close look at macroeconomic accounts with a detailed introduction to public finance. The first five weeks introduce the data needed to assess a national economy, showing how this information can be used to recommend policy changes to improve macroeconomic performance. The first three sessions introduce the accounts and main indicators for an economy s real, external, fiscal, and monetary sectors. The fourth session discusses the relationships among the various accounts, introducing the concept of the flow of funds. The fifth session addresses how to use the information in the accounts to assess an economy and consider policy options to improve its performance.

The second half of the course provides more detail on the institutions involved with fiscal policy. Topics include the rationales for public sector activity, fiscal (public debt) sustainability, revenue policy, expenditure policy, fiscal decentralization, and fiscal rules. If time permits, state enterprises will also be discussed."
ECON6024,Economics of Competition Law,"Antitrust, competition or anti-monopoly laws aim to prevent or discourage businesses from engaging in anticompetitive behaviour. From the enactment of the Sherman Act (1890) in the United States until the 1970s, competition laws existed only in a handful of industrialized countries. In the last few decades, however, many countries around the world have adopted competition policies and established independent competition authorities. Over 130 jurisdictions have adopted competition laws. The OECD observed that Asia-Pacific region witness an increase in the importance of competition policy and law over the past 20 years.

The OECD also observed that economic analysis has played an increasing important role in competition policy debates and competition law enforcement in many jurisdictions around the world.

This course aims at giving students an introduction to the economics analysis undertaken in competition policy and competition law cases. The course will cover competition policy trends, market power and market definition, abuse of dominance, cartels and other anti-competitive agreements, mergers and remedies, and competition impact assessment of government policies and regulations."

ECON6026,Capstone Project,"MSE/MSFE students may choose to undertake a capstone project supervised by SMU faculty who have expertise and interest in the specific topic. Students shall identify a problem, develop the approach and methods needed to address the problem, and conduct the research and present the findings in a written format.

Students are responsible for managing the project with guidance from the Supervisor. This typically includes mastering new concepts, evaluating current research findings, collecting/generating data and information, conducting analysis to formulate solutions or generate new knowledge.

Students are encouraged to connect with their capstone supervisors at regular intervals to ensure progress is made. Interim reports should be submitted regularly to the Supervisor to monitor the progress of the project and refine approaches if necessary."
ECON6027,Spatial Econometrics and Data Analysis,"This course includes concepts and tools used in econometric modelling and statistical analysis of spatial data: data on attributes that are correlated in  space/location  (a.k.a. geo-tagged data). Spatial data are commonly used in regional science and urban economics (related to property prices, crime, household income, etc.), epidemiology and public health (such as disease clusters, etc.), environmental science (climate change, air pollution, ozone density, etc.), ecology, biology, geology, social interactions and network effects, and other disciplines.

We will start the course by looking at practical aspects of organising and visualising spatial data. We will also discuss how to use a coordinate reference system to give spatial awareness to a dataset and make meaningful maps   the main visual aid for spatial data. Then we will consider the statistical and econometric aspects behind spatial data analysis with a special focus on how to re-align classical statistical and econometric techniques towards spatial data for the three broad types of spatial data: (i) point patterns, (ii) areal data and (iii) geostatistical data.

Exploratory spatial data analysis methods, including various plots and tests for spatial autocorrelation, are discussed. Diagnostic tests for complete spatial randomness against spatial clustering or dispersion is an important step in the initial stages of exploratory spatial data analysis. Point pattern analysis and different methods used to measure the degree of spatial autocorrelation will also be discussed. Spatial econometric models and estimation will be discussed in terms of areal data. Spatial econometric models and methods are effective in modelling spatial dependence and thus useful in predicting attributes that are affected/related to its  neighbours. We will focus on the main spatial regression models (spatial lag, spatial error, and spatial Durbin) with and without heteroskedasticity. The usual estimation techniques, quasi-maximum likelihood and GMM methods are discussed for model estimation and inferences. The course will end by discussing main methods of interpolation techniques used in spatial data analysis."

Topics would include the role of economics in health care, demand for health and health services, health insurance, adverse selection and moral hazard, health care suppliers (such as physicians and hospitals), the pharmaceutical market, and individual health behavior. The course is also policy-oriented. We will examine different health care systems across the world, the effects of technology and demographic changes on health care, and major health care policies. Topics would include healthcare financing, population aging, public health issues, and major healthcare reforms and policies in the world."
ENGL001,From Text to Screen: Shakespeare on Film,"This course will deal with Shakespeare in two main ways: the broad approach will be through cultural studies, which are of particular significance for students of management and business. The second will be through study of the media involved (text and screen, i.e. from a script for live performance to a primarily visual rendering) to give detailed understanding of problem-solving."
ENGL002,Creative Writing,"This course aims to get students to look within themselves to find the sources of writing poetry. They are encouraged to find subjects or wait for subjects (if they keep their minds open) to find them. As writing goes hand-in-hand with studying, a poetry textbook will be used, to provide exercises and essential information about poetry and poetry-writing. The main mode of teaching is brief lectures, discussions and workshops. In workshops, students submit poems for peer and instructor scrutiny, followed by revisions. Assessment includes a file of 12 poems, journal writing, short assignments and an interview. In addition, students are exposed to poets reading, disks and a field trip. They are paired for co-operative learning."
ENGL004,Living Better: Literature and Technology,"Few of us realise fully just how tremendous the impact of technology has been in the shaping of our lifestyles and of our attitudes/habits/values. By looking at some of the more profoundly significant books in the field, we will explore how our living can be made better through an understanding of the relationship between technology and living as illustrated by writers like Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, Frederick Ohl and others. This course should prove interesting and beneficial to all who want to know the more subtle aspects of human behaviour - patterns."

The dance traditions of South, South East Asia and East Asia will be examined with a comparative reference to the Western models. Dance traditions of India, Indonesia and Cambodia, will be studied in detail along with a look at traditions of Japan and China. Dance will be studied from different perspectives; as a representation of culture and identity, as a cause for change and as a viable force in today's visual world - like advertisements, films, the internet. Depictions of dance in traditional visual media like sculpture and painting will also be examined."
FNAR002,Art: East and West,"This course is a chronological survey of major period styles and the civilisation of East and West. It will examine and consider the historical and social context, more specifically the correlation of the visual arts with their cultural environment, of art works by renowned artists from the most flourishing periods such as the Sung and Yuan Dynasties in China. Using images and texts, we will examine the relationship between art and the more general worldviews of the different civilisations which produce(d) the art works."
FNCE210,International Finance,"This course introduces the principles of finance in an international context. In a globalized environment, investors and corporations embrace an expanded set of investment opportunities, yet they also face additional risks.

FNCE203,Analysis of Equity Securities,"This course seeks to provide the student with a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the main aspects of valuing equity securities. The first portion of the course lays a foundation for equity valuation by discussing in detail equity return concepts and factors driving firm performance. Then, we cover discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation, which derives the price of equity as the discounted value of future cash flows. In addition, the course describes relative valuation methods, which uses appropriate characteristics (such as the price-to-earnings ratio) to identify over-valued and under-valued stocks. Besides traditional approaches, this course also discusses how unstructured data such as news can be associated with stock valuation."
FNCE204,Analysis of Fixed-Income Securities,"Fixed-income securities deliver cash flows, whose value and risk are strongly influenced by interest rates movements as well as coupon & principal repayment risk. This course will cover the pricing, valuation, and management of fixed-income securities, portfolios, and derivatives.

FNCE316,"Financial Literacy, Inclusion, and Technology","Financial literacy is a critical aspect of building financial resilience across the life cycle, requiring both an understanding of fundamental concepts as well as highly context-specific tools and environments. In Singapore, where many key financial decisions are supported by government programmes, the ability to navigate complex systems has always been key. For example, investing and retirement planning involve a grasp of the country s personal income tax system and the CPF system, while homebuying requires understanding the HDB system and mortgage borrowing. Health insurance choices are centered around the basic provisions of Medishield in combination with a range of options around private providers.

The scope of financial literacy is being redefined, both in Singapore and elsewhere, especially as societies begin to recognize the need for finance to be more inclusive and sustainable. The introduction of new enablers also introduces new risks, particularly in the instance of financial technology (fintech). For instance, as fintech unlocks unprecedented access to new services (such as robo advisors, buy-now-pay-later) and products (such as sustainable or  green  investment funds), it becomes increasingly important to ensure that consumers are sufficiently well-informed or otherwise protected.

This SMU-X course offers an experiential learning opportunity that allows students to translate classroom knowledge about financial literacy into practical solutions for real organizations that represent the forefront of financial innovation.  The course will focus on initiatives related to building individual financial literacy with respect to new goals and financial services in the context of each organization s current or future business model.

FNCE653,Mergers & Acquisitions,"The Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) market is widely regarded as a market for corporate control, where  firms  are  acquired  or  merged  for  a  variety  of  right  or  wrong  reasons. Some  M&A transactions  are  pursued  for  strategic  reasons     to  improve  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency (synergistic) of the underlying business. M&A transactions could also be undertaken by management to pursue their own interests, such as managerial entrenchment, which would be value destroying to the shareholders. In the latter case, the market could intervene by punishing the management via the takeover market.

This course serves to familiarize participants with the nuances of the M&A market.   Specifically, it aims to explain the role that M&A play in corporate strategy development.  In this respect, some of the related questions will be explored: Why firms undertake these transactions?  What is the genesis of  value  in  these  transactions? How  much  value, if  any, is created? Who  gains  from  these transactions? What is the track record of value creation for M&A deals? How does M&A market relate to corporate restructuring?

An important focus is relating the theory to the practical aspect of a deal. Here, participants will be exposed to valuation techniques and issues; structuring considerations; aspects of M&A execution including negotiation strategies, due diligence, documentations, legal and regulatory issues. Post- acquisition integration which is a crucial part of M&A transactions will also be discussed.

This course will be relevant for those planning to pursue a career in finance or general management in a corporate setting as well as those planning to pursue a career in private equity or at a deal intermediary, such as an investment  bank.

FNCE6009,Advanced Quantitative and Economic Analysis,"This course is relevant in the present times. 70% of global GDP is under 0 to 1% interest rates. There is resistance to the idea of interest rates being raised from 0.0%. Emerging economies see capital leaving the country. China s economic future faces big question marks. Eurozone growth expectations are being scaled back and it is printing more money than before. The price of crude oil has suffered a large decline.

Policies pursued in the developed world have disproportionate influence in Asia. Asian countries and other developing nations are forced to operate in a second best world. Emerging markets are forced to cut rates in boom times to discourage inflows and hike rates when capital flows out. They are forced to become a boom-bust economy.

We need to be aware of the world of international finance, economics and policy and capital flows so that we are better prepared in personal, professional and policy worlds."

FNCE6011,Investment Advisory and Wealth Management,"The objective of this module is to introduce the financial planning process and apply some of the tools to formulating an investment plan for managing, preserving and growing wealth for the individual. The body of knowledge in investment management has traditionally been focused on institutions. Institutions differ from individuals as most of them are tax-exempt, unlike individuals who are subject to various taxes. In addition, institutions have much longer investment horizons than individuals. Finally, the objectives and constraints of individuals are more varied than institutions. Hence, the tools and issues for investment management for individuals need to be expanded. 

The formulation of an investment plan for retirement is used as a framework for discussing the various issues in investment management for individuals. Thus, we examine the key challenges and issues pertaining to ensuring that an individual has sufficient funds to live out his/her retirement years. Issues covered include taxation, asset allocation, insurance, annuities, pensions, housing, healthcare, demographics etc.

As this is an emerging area in finance, students will not be learning a well-established body of knowledge but would learn how to think about the issues. In short, there are no quick and easy answers, but rather many questions for us to explore."
FNCE6012,Financial Modeling,"Managers very often need to make important quick decisions. These are usually difficult to justify without a good model and thorough analysis. This course focuses on helping students learn to use spreadsheets as effective tools in financial modeling. Through practices in class, students will be able to develop on their own spreadsheet models, covering representative topics from corporate finance to investments planning and analysis, to analyze trade-offs and sensitivities, and understand implications of uncertainties and risks. The key emphasis of this course is on acquiring the necessary spreadsheet construction skills and developing the art of modeling, more than learning about available financial models."
FNCE6013,Global and Asian Financial Markets,"The course first provides a broad overview of the functions of financial markets, how financial sector development relates to the real economy, and its trends and challenges.

The course then addresses the delicate issue of balancing the needs between financial innovation for development, and financial stability and investor protection. Using real-life case studies, the course illustrates how excessive financial innovation may be harmful, and therefore how financial innovation should be carefully managed and nurtured, and pre-requisite conditions such as financial literacy and education, measures for investor protection etc. should be put in place for financial innovation to work properly.

As the rise of China has profound impact on the global and Asian financial markets, the course next turns its focus on the economy and financial markets of China.

First, an understanding of historical development, current status and challenges of Chinese economy will be helpful. Next, the course provides an overview of the development and current state of financial markets in China, and introduces the various on-going financial reforms such as in interest rate and exchange rate regimes, monetary policy and capital account in China. Lastly, the course discusses the financial supervision in China and the current challenges facing the financial markets in China."
FNCE6014,Structured Products,"Following the ubiquitous nature of derivatives, Structured Products are now very much part of the financial mainstream. This area is characterized by rapid market expansion and product innovation as the acceptance and utilization of derivative structures in the corporate and institutional sectors continues to accelerate. Hybrids appear with increasing frequency as Retail Investment products (e.g. Guaranteed Investment Products or Precipice Bonds) as well as in a more sophisticated institutional forms, in pension, life and other institutional portfolios.

This course will cover the use of structured products by banks and investment managers for investors. We will cover equity structures, fixed income structures, currency structures, commodity structures and hedge fund wrappers. Some of these structures range from simple derivatives like warrants, option-embedded bonds, equity-linked notes, to more sophisticated structures like dual currency options, reverse floaters, range accrual rainbows and similar forms of innovative financial instruments. Participants will obtain a good understanding of the risk and return of some of these products, and their use in investment management.

We will focus on the structures, payoffs, and applications of these products and less emphasis on valuation mathematics. The level of mathematics is much less rigorous than the precedent Derivatives course and once again we will be emphasizing in intuition and concepts rather than mathematical calculus. Starting from the basics of option instruments which are the foundations of many types of structured securities, we will go on to explore the major types of offerings. There will be some basic analysis on pricing but the scope will be limited to practical usage and industry practice."
FNCE6015,Credit Management and Investment Banking Solutions,"The credit management course relates to the risks in wealth management and offers an insight to how taking a proactive approach in understanding and managing client risk could reduce the exposure of a client and bank. Using examples from current trends and developments in the wealth management industry, participants will be shown wealth management activities and the related risks and implications. Collaboration with risk management units will also be discussed to highlight and address practical implications of risk management.

The second part of this course relates to investment banking and corporate finance solutions for business owning high net worth clients.

FNCE6065,Machine Learning and Financial Applications,"Machine learning is the science of using computer algorithms to interpret and make sense of data. The financial market has an abundance of raw data. Using machine learning algorithms, these data can be processed into knowledge and insights, helping quantitative analysts to improve trading strategies, solidify risk management framework, reduce the dimension of big data, classify performance metrics, and implement predictive analytics.

As computing resource becomes cheaper, it is important for quantitative professionals to be proficient in the fundamentals and applications of machine learning, and the ways that machine learning can be used to solve practical problems in the financial markets. This course teaches you how to build automated process to extract patterns from data. You will learn a wide range of machine learning algorithms that can be used to create a model that captures the relationship between the descriptive features and the target features in your dataset.

The course will also give you a solid grounding in the theoretical underpinnings of the most commonly used machine learning techniques, and also equip you with the technical expertise to apply open source machine learning packages in Python. Practitioner knowledge on the use of machine learning, data mining, data analytics, and artificial intelligence in the industry will also be covered."
FNCE6066,Financial Data Science,"We live in the era of financial big data. The datasets finance researchers have at our disposal was unimaginable even only a few years ago: satellite images, credit card transactions, sensor data, web scrapes, sentiment from news and tweets, geolocation of cargos crossing the oceans, and the like. The size of financial data has experienced exponential growth. With computational resources becoming cheaper, these data can be analyzed in full to hunt for hidden patterns or relationships previously undetectable. In recent years, there is a growing need for data specialist with a strong background in financial and quantitative modelling to accelerate digital transformation in both the Singapore and global financial markets.

Unlike most other big datasets, financial data is widely known to be extremely noisy with a weak signal-to-noise ratio. Many patterns uncovered are due purely to randomness. With the availability of advanced machine learning algorithms, financial data scientists with a deep knowledge of financial data properties are in demand. There is a surge of interest in exploring the application of machine learning to financial problem. For example, in 2019 JP Morgan assessed the feasibility of using AI for option pricing, while Hull (2020) explored using reinforcement learning to self-discover the dynamic delta hedging strategy for option pricing. UBS created Evidence Lab focusing in financial data science in 2017. From 2017 onwards, both MAS and MOE have released a series of research funding calls for AI and Machine Learning, with a focus in financial application."

FTW100,Finishing Touch Workshops (Year One),"The FTW100 Year One Workshops is made up of two components: Self-Discovery and Awareness and Career Planning. In all scheduled classes,  Self-Discovery and Awareness  workshop will come before  Career Planning  workshop. Each component is a three-hour session taking place on two different dates.

Self-Discovery and Awareness (FTW101)
The objective of this workshop is to help students learn more about themselves, especially their strengths, what they excel in, their personality traits, things they struggle with, why people respond to them the way they do and how they come across to others. Discovering/ affirming their strengths and potential areas for growth, they could then chart an action plan for growth and identify possible careers/calling and what they need to do to pursue their career of choice or passion. Students would also appreciate the differences in various personality types and how people differ and why they behave the way they do and how they can better communicate and work with others.

Career Planning (FTW102)
The objective is to help students discover their underlying values, interests and skills and how they leverage on their strengths to pursue majors and careers they would excel in. The outcome is for students to formulate a career action planner where they identify their motivators, skills they enjoy using, values they believe in strongly and ultimately derive career goals and potential career path."
FTW200,Finishing Touch Workshops (Year Two),"Building on the knowledge and skills that the students have acquired in the two Year One Finishing Touch workshops, students in the second year will move on to acquire more career preparation skills to equip them for the internship application and bring them a step closer to exploring the career of choice.

The FTW200 Year Two Workshops is made up of five components. Students enrolled in the FTW200 will undertake the FTW200 series under the same instructor for five recurring weeks from Week 3 to Week 7 of the school term. Each component is a three-hour session.

FTW201 Job Search Strategies
Job search strategies will help students who have a general idea of their preferences or bias for certain type of job functions to explore deeper into the career of choice. Students have to perform due diligence and research the industry/job functions they are interested in and what the careers, occupation or their dream job entail and relate it back to their self-assessment and career plan. They need to conduct sufficient research into the companies of choice and how they could  navigate their way  into these companies and job functions. They also need to consider closing skills gaps, if any, and the career path and advancement.

This workshop introduces to students effective job search strategies, informational interviews, how to get insider s information on industry and job function requirements.

The outcome is for students to make a more informed decision on their choice career and options available.


FTW202 Resume and Cover Letter Writing
This workshop will equip students with the skills to write an effective Cover Letter and resume that will help them secure an internship   this is just the basic workshop as most 2nd years will not have sufficient internship or work experience to help them enhance their employability. Students will be exposed to different formats and the effective uses under various circumstances. They will be taught how to create a CV and the sections which are normally included in a CV and the contents to be featured under each section. Advanced CV writing will be taught as an elective in the 3rd or 4th year for those who want help and guidance to strengthen their CVs and start their job applications.

This workshop will focus on how to build a good resume as well as how to craft a resume and cover letter befitting to the industry and internship/job they are applying for.


FTW203 Social Etiquette and Groom for Success
This workshop will deliver to students the knowledge of good personal hygiene and effective grooming and how to conduct themselves in professional and social setting. This workshop should spark their interest to discover themselves and how best to project a confident and professional image as coverage is wide and may not offer sufficient depth. Students are encouraged to do more research on their own or attend workshops which will give them the depth they desire.


FTW204 Personal Branding and Networking Skills
SMU has built a credible brand among the employers however, its brand attributes must also be reflected in its students. There are certain attributes that have attracted employers to SMU students, such as being articulate, innovative, intellectual curiosity, courage to challenge the status quo, adventuresome, skilful and resourceful. The emphasis should be for students to build a believable and consistent long-lasting personal brand with focus on core values for the workplace and in society, not just being well-groomed.

Networking skills are critical for students to succeed. To be effective networkers, they need to understand the acceptable decorum and etiquette for establishing business relationships and friendships; and the  how-tos  of maintaining contacts and building long-term relationships at work and play.

Through this workshop students can be more aware of developing and maintaining a consistent personal brand both in the online and offline world and become more comfortable in having conversations with other peers and professionals in both a social and work-based setting.

FTW205 Interviewing Skills
Interviews can be at times daunting and can be very stressful especially if the candidate walks into an interview without adequate preparation. Students can use the interview session to their advantage to impress the interviewers and present themselves as good potential hires. The interview session is not only to secure an internship or job but also a two way communication to explore and discover whether there is a good fit between the candidate, the job and the organizational and candidate s expectations.

The objective of this workshop is to help students understand the objectives of the interviews, the different types of interviews and equip and practice good interviewing and listening skills in preparation for the internship/job applications."
GA001,Exploring Asian Identities,"This course explores the social, cultural, and political construction of various identities in contemporary Asia. It considers how the jigsaw pieces of history, politics, culture, and society come together in the development of the complex and contested postcolonial Asian nation-states. Using an interdisciplinary approach, the course explores identity politics related to nationalism, multiculturalism, religion, race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality in light of recent social, economic, and political transformations in the region associated to globalization and modernization."
GA002,"Contemporary Asia: Power, Diversity & Change","Home to around forty percent of the world's population, Asia is a region of extraordinary natural, cultural, economic, and socio-political diversity. It is characterised by both patterns of continuity across time and space, as well as far-reaching and rapid social and physical change. This course surveys a variety of contemporary trends and challenges found across Asia. By exploring weekly themes such as urbanisation, transnational migration, civil society and social movements, religious politics, security issues, environmental degradation, geopolitics and the role of China, economic growth and disparity, and regional structures like ASEAN and SAARC, students will gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of contemporary Asian societies. At some points in this course we will approach  Asia  with a wide-lens, taking global, transnational, and regional perspectives, while at other times we will zoom in to particular experiences at a national or sub-national level. This is a survey course, and while students will be exposed to a wide range of issues relevant to contemporary Asia, they will also be encouraged to delve deeper into one or two select topics that are of particular interest to them."
GA102,Southeast Asian Literature,"Over the years it has become quite clear that South East Asia possesses a rich storehouse of literatures, both in the indigenous languages as well as, more recently, in the languages of the *colonizing* master. Southeast Asia is becoming a region to reckon with, housing some 600+ millions of human beings living in all manner of complex formations. It is a region fast transforming itself in the face of stiff global competition as well as heavy political pressure to conform to new expectations of its citizens. From Myanmar to the Philippines there are writers who have contributed significantly to helping their nations in terms of an honest depiction of realities-whether social, political, economic or cultural. This course seeks to explore some of the major writers of the region so as to offer a deeper realization of the region's complexity. Examples of writers we will be looking at are K S Maniam (Malaysia), Mochtar Lubis (Indonesia), F Sionil Jose (Philippines), Goh Poh Seng (Singapore)."
GA103,Changing Public Policy in Singapore,"Singapore is not only a new country, but one which went through types of government in the last two centuries of its modern history.  What contributed to Singapore retaining its identity despite these changes? What are some of the challenges facing its present identity?  How can its public policy be managed and harnessed to the good of Singapore and her people?

This course seeks to understand and critically examine the changes in the public policy of Singapore since its formation as an East India Company settlement in 1819.  The focus is on the way the place has been governed, as how from a mere place, it has become a nation and seeks to maintain and enhance this nationhood in a turbulent world."
GA201,Popular Culture in Asia,"This course examines popular culture in a range of Asian countries in light of recent economic and political transformations in the region. It explores the ways in which consumer fashion, popular practices, entertainment, and media messages are shaped by class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and generational relations, as well as by rural-urban differences and contending political ideologies. It considers how globalization and westernization intersect with indigenous and national traditions in the region."
GA203,History of Southeast Asia,"Starting with a brief overview of key geographic characteristics and cultural-historical patterns, the main emphasis of this course is on the vast historical changes that swept through the crossroads region today known as  Southeast Asia  during the last 150 or so years. How were the wide range of polities   such as sea nomads, hill tribes, sultanates, principalities, and bureaucratic kingdoms   reduced to the ten independent states that remain today? What was the foreign, what was the  indigenous  contribution to this state consolidation? How did colonialism and different paths to independence and post-colonial policies radically change peoples  political, economic, social, and cultural life worlds over the course of a few generations?"
GA205,Managing Diversity in Asia,"This course explores various models in managing diversity in Asia. It examines forms of  difference  such as ethnicity, religion and sexuality, and policy frameworks are important for multicultural societies. The course critically engages with the debates within scholarship of multiculturalism that encourages a theoretically-informed approach towards a range of empirical examples from Europe, North America and Asia. The analysis of empirical examples enables the consideration of demographic, cultural and ideological particularities, as well as nation-building efforts that vary across historical and geographical environments. This context-driven approach will also be taken towards the analysis of contemporary policy issues including citizenship, education and employment, including current debates such as disability in education and the  headscarf affair . The course also includes an applied component which allows students to put the theories to use and to experience how to deal with diversity through three dialogue sessions outside the campus."
GA303,"Special Topics in Asian History, Culture, and Society","This is a special topic course and the selected topic, which may vary from year to year, will be taught based on the research expertise of the instructor.  The course will provide students an opportunity to have a more in-depth understanding of selected issues in Asian history, culture, and society."

The course will provide students an opportunity to have a more in-depth understanding of selected issues in Asian politics, economics, and law."
GA305,Global Asia Study Mission,"The Global Asia Study Mission takes students to a country in Asia to study the cultural, economic, social and political life of the country at first hand. Each Study Mission will be designed around a theme or a set of issues. Students will be given a number preparatory sessions in SMU in which they will discuss research materials and related literature centered on the chosen theme. This will lay the theoretical foundation for the parts of the course that will be carried out in the country they will be visiting. The purpose of the GA Study Mission is to allow students to unify theory and practice by combining what they have learned in the class room with on the ground empirical studies and fieldwork in a foreign country."
GA306,Special Project,This course is designed to enrich students  experience by allowing them to exchange ideas and work on projects together with students of a partner university. Students enrolled in this course may also be given the opportunity to visit the campus of the partner university and physically engage in intellectual discussions in the classroom of their counterparts. This innovative course gives students international exposure by facilitating learning beyond borders.
GA307,IAS/GA Independent Project,"Students may choose to undertake an independent study/project on a specific topic of interest relevant to international and/or Asian studies, which is not available in regularly offered course. Students will conduct an original study or project under the supervision of a faculty. The student will be actively involved in all stages of the project, including the formulation of the topic interest.

The independent project is limited to students who are seniors with a minimum 3.30 cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA). A student may do only one IAS independent project to count towards the major requirement. Interested students should ask for the application form from the School."

HUMN004,Culture Identities and Arts,"This course examines how a community may express its values and belief systems in its arts as well as popular images in mass media.  The course provides insights into cultures, identities and world views by examining the relationships linking these constructs and the process of sense-making in the arts and related objects.  Objects examined may include the visual and performing arts, films, historical artifacts, and popular images in mass media.  Emphasis will be given to the Asian cultural and societal contexts."
HUMN009,Why We Work: Different Perspectives on the Value of Work and Play,"Most people spend much of their time working. But not everyone is miserable and unhappy like the quote above claims. What some do as work (in exchange for money), others would gladly do for free. Work is something that most people engage in for economic gain, but the social, psychological, and even political impact is less often examined. Conversely, leisure is often seen as the opposite of work. But some studies indicate that people might actually feel more engaged with work than leisure activities (Csikszentmihalyi, 2008). In this course we explore what work means to people, what leisure provides that work does not, and how individuals go about finding a balance between work and non-work in their lives.

Broadly, the objective of this course is to provide students an opportunity to examine and reflect on different perspectives of work and non-work, and to start them on a journey to determine for themselves what work and non-work could be like in their own lives. Specifically, through class discussions and project work, I hope to be able to provide students a broad perspective on what constitutes work and non-work. This sets the stage for them to apply these perspectives to their own lives, and to gain insights for themselves regarding a possible balance between work and non-work, both in the present and the future."
HUMN010,Governance of Ethnic Relations in Singapore,"Singapore has been touted as a success story in its maintenance of stable ethnic relations. Despite its beginnings as an improbable nation, Singapore's economic success has been dependent on political stability, of which the absence of overt ethnic conflict is fundamental. Yet, stable and meaningful ethnic relations cannot be left to chance. Indeed, a very deliberate and conscious effort, requiring a mixture of laws, institutions, mechanisms and political leadership and will, is needed to maintain ethnic relations in Singapore.

This course seeks to understand and to critically examine the legal framework and policies for the management of ethnic relations in Singapore. Laws alone are manifestly inadequate in maintaining peace on hot-button issues of race, language, and religion.

The course will also examine the political framework in place that complements the legal and policy infrastructure. Comparative studies will be done, where applicable, to articulate the key themes and issues."
HUMN011,20th Century Chinese Literature: Socio-ideological Evolution,"This course seeks to facilitate understanding of the socio-ideological evolution in China in the 20th century onwards, based on the reading of representative texts by a collection of ten canonical writers, namely, Lu Xun, Ba Jin, Lao She, Lin Yutang, Wang Meng, Zhang Jie, Jia Pingwa, Mo Yan, Wang Anyi and Yu Hua. The English translation of novel chapters/short stories will be studied, with reference to the original, as well as the relevant movie/TV drama version. In addition to investigating socio-ideological issues reflected in the texts, the course also discusses Chinese culture via literary representation devices such as setting and characterization."
HUMN012,Education and Society,"The course provides a context to interrogate theoretical perspectives and relevant literature on the aims of education, and critical issues and policy dilemmas that surround education and schooling. It will cover topics such as the following:

  The Philosophy of Education (the purpose of schooling and ideologies behind educational approaches will be discussed)
  The Politics of Education (the politicisation of education, meritocracy and increasing social stratification, and the debate on social inclusion will be discussed)
  The Language of Education (identity and culture, decisions on the medium of instruction for school systems, and policies such as bilingualism and SAP schools will be discussed)
  Technology in Education (the future of schooling, role of the teacher, virtual worlds, gaming and 21st century competencies, as well as MOOCs will be discussed)
  Globalisation and Education (the role of elite schools, access to higher education, internationalisation of education and international comparison studies will be discussed)
  Education and the Moral Being (the role of religious and moral education, and the issue of who is responsible for the mores and morality of a society will be discussed)"
HUMN013,Women and New Media,"A number of studies have shown that women are stronger  prosumers  of social media than men. Women are more likely to get news from social platforms, and share news through social media, FaceBook or email compared to men. With the growing dominance of the Internet, blogs, chats and mobile telephony, communication is rapidly changing and becoming more interactive, personalized and multi-channel. This revolution is affecting the basic structure of many societies and raising discussions and debates that are profoundly related to women such as the blurring of the boundaries between public and private spaces, and the legitimacy of social identities. Also contested are the relationship between new media and women activism, new technology and women s oral literature and the changes in the relationship between written and oral languages as well as the challenges posed by women transmitting knowledge in new ways."
HUMN015,"Global-City Stage - Singapore in the World, the World in Singapore","Singapore has risen from Third World to First in less than half a century of rapid development.  The course analyses this extraordinary transition from a variety of perspectives and disciplines.  It examines the city-state s ties in the region and with the wider world.  It looks in particular at how Singapore s domestic priorities and foreign policy imperatives have influenced its relationships with trading partners and how these partners have played an important part in its economic and social transformation.

The course is designed for SMU students who seek a deeper understanding of Singapore s metamorphosis. It will appeal especially to international and exchange students who may be puzzled by Singapore s distinctive blend of market freedom and state interventions to promote economic growth and social harmony. 

The course is organized around a series of talks by policymakers, analysts, business leaders and diplomats. Participants will write essays or develop projects on the multi-faceted interactions of a chosen country/region with Singapore.  The objective is to produce in mid-2015 a book of essays that addresses the place of Singapore in the world today and how that world has shaped through ideas, trade and cultural links Singapore s self-image and identity."
HUMN016,Foundations of Societal Leadership,"The course aims to develop in students a deeper understanding of societal leadership, which is defined as leadership that creates sustainable value and impact for the betterment of society. Participants will develop a keen awareness of the Southeast Asian region and better understand the key social challenges that cut across nations.  They will better appreciate what individuals, no matter their career choice, can contribute to social impact. Hearing perspectives of CEOs and key leaders for instance, from Wildlife Reserves or SINDA, or NTUC Foodfare will enable them to understand and assess the strategic decisions and impact made by these organisations that desire to work towards social good.

The course should appeal to students who are interested in social engagement and leadership, and who are planning to or would like to contribute meaningfully to social impact organisations in their community or set up their own social enterprise."
HUMN017,A Cultural Introduction to India: From Indus Valley to Infosys,"India is evolving rapidly, after many years of very slow economic growth and development.  Singapore and India have shared historical connections; recently, these ties are being nurtured through policies of both governments which encourage closer business contacts. This course will provide the cultural background through which a closer understanding of this vast subcontinent of India and its people can be achieved.  The course will introduce the cultures of the different geographical regions of India, and will highlight the role of religion, the arts (including classical music, dance, sculpture, temple architecture), literature and media (including the press, broadcast television and films) in shaping the psyche of the Indian mind."
HUMN018,Understanding Singapore Politics,"The overall objective of this course is to share and expose students to the many different ways by which one can understand Singapore Politics.

Enrolling in this course will enable students to understand the key political  actors  and institutions that shapes the content and contours of this Republic s society and political landscape as well as critically reflect on some pertinent challenges confronting this global city-state now and the near future."
HUMN019,Asian Organised Crime: A Multidisciplinary Perspective,"Organised crime is a multi-factorial social problem. The study of organised crime in Asia has stimulated empirical investigations into a diversity of phenomena including the racialisation of criminals, supply chain organisation of illegal goods and services, corruption of legitimate actors and institutions, white collar criminality, and issues related to legislative frameworks and law enforcment efforts. Although the core subject is crime, efforts to understand, control, and eradicate organised crime in Asia has never been a uniquely criminological or even uniquely sociological endeavor. Instead of a monopoly by any single discipline, research into the field of organised crime in Asia has attracted scholars with diverse academic backgrounds including, psychology, economics, history, law and political science.

This course systematically charts and analyses the multidisciplinary dimensions of the study of organised crime in Asia, by drawing on scientific research done in the field of psychology, sociology, economics, political science, criminology, and cultural studies. Drawing on case study analysis of organised crime in Asia, metaphorical and substantive references to its interdisciplinary dimension will be highlighted on five levels of observation: the individual  organised criminal , the activities these individuals are involved in, the associational patterns through which they are connected, the power structures that subordinate these individuals and collectives to common or particular interests, and the relations between these individuals, structures and activities on the one hand, and the legal spheres of society on the other. Subsequently, the course will highlight the advantages and critique the limitations of a multidisciplinary analysis of organised crime in Asia. In general, the study of organised crime has profited from an multidisciplinary approach. In these cases, concepts and theories have been adopted either on the assumption that organised crime is a facet of a larger phenomenon under investigation in other disciplines, or on the assumption that sufficient similarities exist between organised crime and the objects of study of other disciplines in order to permit the drawing of analogies. However, it is equally important to address the caveat that unless the borrowing of eclectic oncepts and theories from a variety of academic disciplines is strategically done to build up a cumulative body of knowledge, efforts to conceptualise, theorise, and police the complex phenomenon of organised crime in Asia will be compromised rather than facilitated."
HUMN021,Religions in Asia,"Globalization   the swiftness of modern transportation and the speed of information transfer   has made our world borderless. Many populations and governments feel they are unable to cope with the size of this playing field. People feel insecure and governments respond with populist inward-looking nationalism. However, we are individuals in societies. We cannot get away from living with people whose cultures and values we do not understand. Even if we bury our heads in the sand, the globalized world will not go away, for it is a fact of modern times. All of us will have to deal with people from diverse cultures in order to work and live successfully today.

This course gives insight into the thinking of communities other than our own. Religion is a primal response of man. Religion moves people beyond the rational to the transcendental and engenders such strong feelings people will go to war, and are willing to die for their faiths. Asia is the frontier of future economic development. It is crucial to know Asian society and culture for encounters with Asia can only increase."
IAS202,Asia and the World in the Twentieth Century,"Why did Asian elites adopt  modern  political ideologies to deal with socio-cultural transformation and foreign threats? How did they convince the primarily rural  masses  to follow them? What strategies emerged as the most successful and to what extent were the eventual outcomes different due to a mix of domestic and international factors?  These are some of the questions that we try to answer in this course by examining the historical forces   indigenous, foreign, and transnational   that were transforming a vast region stretching from the Indian subcontinent via the Southeast Asian crossroads to the East of Asia during the (roughly) 1875-1975 period and that would lead to the invention of new form of politics."
IAS301,"Culture, Society, and Religion in Contemporary Indonesia","This course introduces students to contemporary Indonesia, including analysis of Indonesia s social and cultural background, ethnic relations, religious practices, and inter-religious relations. It examines the nature and viability of Indonesia as modern nation-state and explores both unifying and divisive forces in relation to the continued existence of this nation-state. We survey various social groups with regard to their unique features and to the ways in which they accommodate and are accommodated by the Indonesian nation-state. A key focus will be on the interplay of religious, ethnic, and national identities amidst the competing forces of globalization, localization, and hybridization."
IAS302,Emerging Powers in Asia,"The twenty first century is witnessing a major shift in global economic and political power from the West to the East. China and India, in particular, have become increasingly important forces to be reckoned with, and are emerging as potential hegemonic powers on the world stage. This course examines the political, economic and social implications of the rise of Asia to the new world order. It considers the reconfiguration of international relations in Asia and the industrialised countries in the West and explores the opportunities and potential problems associated in such development, exploring in particular its implications for Southeast Asia."
IDIS001,Analytical Skills,"This course aims to teach students the basic skills of evaluating arguments and constructing arguments. At the end of the course students should be able to identify the structures of real-life arguments in order to decide if they are good or bad, and to argue logically about things that matter."
IDIS009,"Intellectual Assets, Technology and Society","This course conceptualises a new branch of industrial management and economics of growing importance worldwide in industries of all types. The course arises from a need to provide students with concepts and tools for analysing intellectual property assets of all types in a broad context. Innovations of all sorts, not just technical innovations, provide the most important source of industrial competitiveness, economic growth, and welfare. These developments call for skills in intellectual asset management and not only in its legal aspects, but equally important in its economic, social, managerial and technology aspects. The course aims to provide perspectives, concepts, models, and methods that provide a theoretical and practically oriented toolkit for analysis of innovations from different considerations."
IDIS010,Southeast Asia: Past and Present,"This is an interdisciplinary survey course on the regional grouping that is today called Southeast Asia, with an emphasis on the modern era (post-World War Two). The class materials are designed to provide students foundational knowledge regarding the origins of Southeast Asia as a geopolitical entity as well as background on some of the major countries in the region. We examine the cultural traditions that have shaped the region as well as the political influences and events that shape Southeast Asian countries today. In doing so, we study how the past has shaped the present. Thus, the course engages in a broad historical overview, but it is not designed to be a strictly history course. Rather, it is intended to equip students with a general knowledge of Southeast Asian cultures, histories, and politics. By the end of the course, students will have a better appreciation of the challenges that face Southeast Asia today as well as an understanding of Singapore s position in the region."
IDIS100,Research Methods in Sociology and Political Science,"How do we transform our everyday observations of the world into social scientific knowledge? At its core, this is a question about research design, particularly reviewing the literature, formulating questions, hypothesis testing, data collection, and data analysis. This course will provide a brief introduction to all the major social science research methods, particularly experiments, quasi-experiments (observational), surveys, fieldwork/ethnography, and use of historical/documentary sources. Basic principles of ethical research design will also be covered."
IDIS102,"The Business of ""Fun"""," Fun  needs to be put into perspective: the Business of  Fun  embodies leisure, entertainment and recreation activities.  Fun is also about travel and tourism.  In reality, most of how we preoccupy ourselves between work and sleep is within the realm of  fun . In reality,  fun  should be deemed as the sociocultural fabric of a country, city and community.

From an organizational perspective,  fun  is also about a corporate culture that encourages creativity, innovation and customer-centric decision-making, therefore transcends business sectors and industries.

Through case studies from global leaders in the leisure entertainment business like Disney, Merlin Entertainment and Universal Studios; Asia s leading destinations and resorts   Hong Kong s Ocean Park, Australia s Gold Coast and Singapore s Sentosa Island; and, the industry s leading experience engineers   Marty Sklar, Bob Rogers and Bernard Harrison, students will have a deeper  behind-the-scenes  appreciation of how mindful and meaningful experience are created and delivered.  Out-of-classroom sessions will bring theoretical concepts and practical insights into the real-world context."
IDIS103,"Understanding Drone & Robotic Technology - History, Usage, Ethics & Legal Issues","This new course is a response to the increasing use of drone technology and 3D robotics in business and society. Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War  I  when  the  US  army  experimented  with  unmanned  aerial  torpedoes.  Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations.  Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various drone functionalities in order to critically assess drone technology and to articulate informed opinions about  the good ,  the bad , and  the future  of unmanned aerial vehicles. The course will be taught by a multi-disciplinary team of instructors from three different SMU schools (LKCSB, SIS and SOL)  plus exposure to drone entrepreneurs  and  first-hand,  team-based  experiences  in  piloting  mini drones  within  the SMU campus."
IDIS110,Social Science Practicum,"The Social Science Practicum (SSP) is a compulsory module for all BSocSc students. The goal of the SSP is to encourage the development of students as creative and curious learners ready to adapt to the challenges of a complex world. Every SSP section will be organized around a specific real-world question or problem. Within this issue, students will have license to shape a team project around what they think is interesting and important. The SSP will culminate in a showcase where student teams share their findings with the SOSS community."
IDIS300,Scholars Study Mission,"In an increasingly globalized world, there is greater interdependencies amongst nations, and developments in one country can have rippled effects on others. It is crucial, therefore, for students to have a better appreciation of the economic, political, and cultural environments in different countries, and their implications for Singapore. 

This Study Mission course is aimed at inculcating a global mindset in students. Each year, a country which has important economic relationships with Singapore will be selected. The trip will provide students with a better understanding of economic policies and developments in the country visited. There will be visits to governmental agencies and corporations. Prior to the trip, students will work singly and in groups on research projects and cases.  Country experts and corporate executives will speak at seminars prior to and during the trip.

Students will learn about the country s economic policies, key industries, foreign direct investments, financial and banking sectors, capital market, and regulatory and tax regime. They will gain insights into how politics and culture impact the way businesses operate, business and investment opportunities in the country, and management strategies and practices of companies.  The trip will provide opportunities to interact with business leaders, and cultivate valuable networks. It will prepare students to be world ready."
IDIS301,GIS Capstone: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Achieving Significance in the Third Age,"Longer life expectancies, coupled with better health, have led to the emergence of the Third Age a long span of time when older adults are free of their career and family responsibilities, and before the onset of the physical, emotional and cognitive limitations. In Singapore, this will refer to an older adult between 65 and 80+ years old. The Third Age offers opportunities and possibilities for a life of purpose and significance.
This Capstone course challenges students to apply knowledge and skills in their discipline to tackle the psychological, sociological, economics, and management challenges of a rapidly ageing society. It is a unique learning opportunity that emphasize the application of academic knowledge accumulated in prior core courses to solving real world problems. The course develops in students an ability to identify problems and develop solutions by analytic review and abstract idea generation. To achieve this, the capstone will simulate the  real world  through the development/implementation of innovative solutions to real client projects. Students will have the opportunity to assist industry partners make a positive impact in their efforts to engage the third agers in Singapore.
Classroom sessions and SMU-X project will lead students to dive deeper into disciplines like gerontology (in particular, life span development framework of Third Age), social sciences (intergenerational), organizational behavior (diverse workplace), business management strategies (silver industry), economics, artificial intelligence & technology (in particular, elder-technology) related to the ageing population in Singapore.
The course will proceed by envisaging different aspects of ageing and society through published works on life in the Third Age including books, academic journal articles, case studies. Students will be working with our SMU-X industry partner, The Lien Foundation on their projects in the ageing space. Projects include the design of community space for older adults at the National Museum, and other initiatives to support Aging in Place at Yishun Community Hospital."
IDIS610,Sustainability and Metrics: Measuring Success in the 21st Century," You do what you measure.   What you can measure you can manage.   If you can t measure it, you can t manage it.   You are what you measure. 

All these variations on the standard business mantra are titles of articles that then explain why the mantra is wrong, or at best incomplete.  Measuring anything requires us to put numbers on it, or at least somehow to define what it is that we are measuring.  Sometimes such quantification clarifies our thinking, shows us what impact we are actually having, provides feedback that helps us improve what we are doing, and enables accountability to stakeholders who are affected by our actions.  Sometimes it fixates us on things that don t matter rather than those that do, or pushes us in the wrong direction as we strive to look good according to badly designed metrics.

The metrics to assess sustainability and partnerships are still at best in development. As organizations in all three sectors experience a major push for enhancing social and environmental sustain-ability, often by means of cross-sector partnerships, a plethora of standards, metrics, and reporting requirements are emerging that purport to enable appropriate measurement and accountability.  But there is little agreement on what sustainability means, how to achieve it, or how to measure our behavior relative to sustainability standards: i.e., to know whether a given action is moving us in the right   or wrong   direction.  There is even less agreement on how to measure the contribution of cross-sector collaborations.

Previous MTSC courses have addressed the world s major challenges and various approaches to understanding and managing them. In this module, we extend this to focus on how sustainability can be defined in actionable terms, looking at concepts of financial, social, and natural capital. We then investigate the leading experiments in measuring sustainability performance and partnership performance, building on our previous discussions of accountability. 

Throughout the module, we focus on a set of questions that policymakers and practitioners are currently grappling with around the world. 

  Can the Sustainable Development Goals and/or concepts such as natural and social capital and/or Planetary Boundaries provide effective markers against which to evaluate organiza-tional and system behavior and outcomes?

  Do we have the data needed to know whether we are crossing planetary boundaries or achieving the SDGs and other global goals?

  Do the various metrics and evaluation systems give us useful information? To whom is it useful?

  Under what conditions do reporting requirements and investment indices shape organiza-tions  behavior, and in what directions?

  What do we know about the impact of cross-sector collaboration, as opposed to other approaches to large-scale problem-solving and systems change?"
IDIS612,Policy Task Force: Group Capstone,"In the first half of the MTSC, the entire cohort of MTSC students considers a set of candidate policy issues that seem to require cross-sector collaboration to be effectively addressed. By the end of the IDIS 601 session (Scenarios and Futures Technologies), the cohort selects a number of topics for the Policy Task Forces, self-selecting themselves into groups for each topic.

During each subsequent module, time is set aside for the cohort to work on the policy task force. The cohort self-organizes (in close consultation with the instructor and other team members), selecting a set of sub-themes to investigate, identifying relevant stakeholders and potential participants in a cross-sector collaboration, and drawing upon all the knowledge and skills learned in the MTSC to take the initial steps toward the creation of an effective cross-sector collaboration."

IDIS700,Machine Learning for Social Science,"This course explores a wide swath of machine learning tools that are both 1) practical for social science research and 2) readily available to implement. Each week will cover a different methodology, either a machine learning technique or a more fundamental technique upon which machine learning methods can be applied. Lessons will consist of two parts: a review of two to three papers that utilize the week s methodology (usually applied papers, occasionally review papers or more technical papers), and an overview of how the methodology works, presented alongside a worked-out example implementing the methodology."
IDIS701,Applied Econometrics for Social Science Research,"This is a university-wide Ph.D. seminar course in applied econometrics for social science research. The course aims to expose students to current and classic studies in various empirical methods across various social science disciplines: economics, finance, accounting, strategy, organizational behaviour, social science, political science, etc. The topics which will be covered in the course include linear regression models, panel data, instrumental variables, (quasi)natural experiment, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, matching and selection models, standard errors, etc."
IDIS702,Introduction to Interdisciplinary Research,"Disciplines within the social sciences have given analytical primacy to either the environment (sociology, for instance) or the agent (psychology, for instance) or the interaction (the rational choice school within economics, for instance). As such, the disciplinarily   limited study of social science provides an incomplete understanding of social action. Interdisciplinary work within the social sciences is an attempt to redress this flaw. Interdisciplinary social science then can be defined, equally pithily, as the integrated study of social action. This course is designed to introduce you to the nature and modes of, the steps involved in and the integrative frameworks for pursuing interdisciplinary social science.

The course is divided into three relatively self-contained units. The first unit (seminars 1-5) explores the nature and purpose of knowledge in the social sciences and, in this context, discusses the epistemic goals and the methodological individualism of the different disciplines within the social sciences. The second unit (seminars 6-8) presents several extant sites of interdisciplinary cooperation within the social sciences. The third unit (seminars 9-12) prepares you for engaging in interdisciplinary research; it introduces the different modes of interdisciplinary research and the tasks associated with such research, builds rudimentary familiarity with data-based reasoning, and concludes the course by providing practical advice on implementing an interdisciplinary research project."

IDST716,Independent Study,"The independent study course affords students an opportunity to conduct an individual project focused on research, literature review, or/and an extension of other coursework. The student must first formulate an idea for an independent study and then approach a College of Integrative Studies faculty in a related field. The course can proceed only if the student secures the agreement of a faculty to take on a supervisor role. For the avoidance of doubt, a student s PhD supervisor may serve as the supervisor for an independent study course if the faculty member s expertise area is aligned with the direction of the independent study.

All projects are to be completed by the student working independently with guidance, as
needed, from their supervisor. The student is responsible for organising the nature of the project and the scheduling of assignments, in consultation with the supervisor. Although the student is expected to work independently, there must be a minimum of six meetings between the student and supervisor across the term. These meetings may be conducted online or via online means and need not be documented."
INDN201,Bahasa Indonesia,"Bahasa Indonesia is the most widely spoken language in Southeast Asia. It is the official language of the Republic of Indonesia, and is closely related to various versions of Malay used in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. With the rapid development of Asia, the language is seen as an important vehicle towards greater cooperation amongst people of the region. Learning Indonesian will benefit students for both personal and professional reasons.

This course provides an introduction to contemporary spoken and written Indonesian. Focusing on conversational Indonesian, the course will develop students  ability to conduct simple conversations in Indonesian in everyday situations. At the end of the course, students will be able to satisfy their basic transactional needs in Indonesian through speaking and listening, initiate and sustain simple conversations, understand simple texts, and write very short series of original sentences related to their own survival needs or on very familiar topics.

Enrolment condition: Bahasa Indonesia is designed for students with no previous background in Indonesian or Malay. You must be a complete beginner to enroll in the course."
INTS001,"Perspectives, Challenges, and Insights in Singapore","The purpose of this course is to provide participants with an understanding of Singapore, including its business, social, cultural, economic, and political landscape.
At the same time, this is an SMU-X module, which offers an experiential learning opportunity for foreign students enabling them to translate classroom knowledge and theory into practical solutions for companies (organizations) based in Singapore, through real consultancy projects. Through the consultancy experience, students will learn how to solve real-world problems with guidance from the faculty and project sponsor mentors, while simultaneously testing their critical-thinking skills. The project will focus on existing (and future) challenges in issues such as digital transformation, sustainability or growth in Asia that are faced by companies/organizations in Singapore and students are encouraged to offer their perspectives and insights to tackle these real-world problems. The course qualifies for one credit unit and encompasses seminars, guest lectures and presentations all held in Singapore."
INTS101,Methods Across Majors: An Interdisciplinary Introduction to Research,"This course is not a typical introductory research methods course. The primary objective of this course is to empower students to critically engage with research findings across multiple disciplines by understanding the methods used, their strengths and limitations, and whether said methods have been used correctly. To do so, students will begin by interrogating the  objectivity  of scientific evidence. Students will then be introduced (intuitively) to three fundamental statistical approaches: hypothesis testing, linear regression, and experimental methods. The use of these three fundamental approaches will be critiqued by examining how statistics are often done wrong and replicating existing studies.

INTS700,"Cities in Asia: Planning, Policy, and Praxis","How do urban spatial forms emerge? What roles do urban planning and policy play in their production? And how are these official practices of city-making mediated by local histories, social relations, and political economic arrangements? This postgraduate seminar considers these questions from the vantage of urban (and urbanizing) Asia. Through scholarship drawn from the fields of urban studies, geography, and anthropology, students will grapple with the challenge of developing urban theory adequate to the variation in metropolitan trajectories and configurations across the continent. Each class session will use a different element of the urban built environment   including roads, parks, ports, malls, and gated communities   to orient considerations of how planning, policy, and praxis contribute to the production of recognizably urban places. We will approach these material elements of the urban fabric as dynamic rather than static, examining the diverse ways in which people imagine, make, inhabit, use, contest, and remember particular sites and spaces. We will also explore how the built environment mediates a range of pressing challenges faced by contemporary Asian cities, including global climate change, rising inequality, rapid expansion, and political exclusion."

IS457,Fairness in Socio-technical Systems,"We interact with a variety of services and systems in our daily lives. While manual labors still take some part in those systems, some other parts become more and more automated by artificial intelligence (AI). In general, we might expect that those systems treat users fairly. If the system uses AI that is built on big data and complex algorithms, such expectation would be strengthened. Compared to human labor that might involve subjective decision-making, algorithmic systems are expected to objectively work and treat users fairly. However, in recent years, there are raising concerns about the potential harms of those systems, which are rooted in biases embedded in socio-technical systems. The inherent opaque nature of AI systems makes the problem worse.
For example, YouTube recommends next videos when a video is finished playing. Those recommendations, on the one hand, are helpful to find interesting videos from a tremendous number of YouTube videos, but on the other hand, it is often unclear how or why the video is recommended. What happens if some biases exist in the recommendation algorithm, such as favoring videos with a specific (political) view? No matter whether those biases are intentional or unintentional, users would be exposed to a certain set of videos and are likely to be influenced by them. 
YouTube is only one out of many examples because AI systems are becoming pervasive these days. In various areas, including healthcare, hiring, financial service, ads, policymaking, and internet services, AI systems are actively used. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that those systems are working fairly without any potential biases. It might be overlooked that the biases are embedded not only in the AI systems but also in established processes or human operators within the systems.
The goal of this course is to provide students with an extensive understanding of diverse concepts of fairness and bias in socio-technical systems through examples across diverse domains, from healthcare to internet search. Then, students will learn how to audit practical systems in terms of fairness and bias through recent case studies. The course also aims to understand public concerns related to AI systems and help students to deeply think about ethical AI within multiple social contexts."

ISFS623,Risktech and Regtech,"Along with sales, risk and regulatory concerns determine the success or failure of financial institutions. When banks misprice risk associated with financial products or take on too much risk, they endanger their overall profitability. Likewise, when legal and regulatory compliance  are mismanaged, banks can incur substantial fines, suffer reputational damage, and become subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny. Accordingly, efficient and effective management of risk and regulatory compliance is a core focus for banks' management. Because of its mathematical nature, risk calculation, extensively leveraged technology for several decades. On the other hand, a long-standing approach that banks have used to deal with gaps in regulatory compliance and increasing regulation has been to ""throw more bodies"" at the problem.  This approach has been costly, inefficient, and, in some cases, ineffective.  As a result, Regtech solutions have been developed that help banks use technology to address compliance-related challenges.

This course begins by providing an introduction to Risktech, technology that is used to support banks' risk management activities.  It reviews the main types of risks that banks encounter: market risk, credit risk, and operational risk and the processes and techniques used to measure those risks. Challenges related to managing risk data and performing risk calculations are reviewed along with related technology approaches.

ISSS604,Operations Analytics and Applications,"Every service sector business is faced with operations related problems including demand forecasting, inventory management, distribution management, capacity planning, resource allocation, work scheduling, and queue & cycle time management.

Very often, the business owner knows that problems exist but has no idea what caused the problems, and therefore does not know what to do to solve the problems. In this course, students will be exposed to the Data and Decision Analytics Framework which helps the analyst identify the actual cause of business problems by collecting, preparing, and exploring data to gain business insights, before proposing what objectives and solutions can and should be done to solve the problems. Such a framework combines identification of the root causes by data analytics, and proposing solutions supported by decision analytics.

The goals of this course are for students to (a) develop a strong understanding of the theory, concepts and techniques of operations management and data driven analytics, and (b) apply that understanding in creating cutting-edge business analytics applications and IT solutions for service industry companies to gain operation insights and business improvements. Students will apply the Data and Decision Analytics Framework to solve several operations focused case studies. This framework is an expansion of a typical operations management solution methodology to include data analytics so as to exploit the linkages across processes, data, operations, analytics and technology, to offer businesses alternative solutions to operations problems."
ISSS606,Social Analytics and Applications,"This course focuses on data analytics in the context of social media. Increasingly people interact with each other on social media on a daily basis, which generates a huge amount of social data. We are primarily interested in two types of social data: social relationship networks, such as friendship networks and professional networks, and social text data such as user reviews and social status updates. Thus, this course integrates both network (formerly known as graph) mining and text analytics, with more emphasis on the network portion.  

This course will prepare you with the fundamental data science and programming skills to process and analyze social data, in order to reveal valuable insights and discover knowledge for making better decisions in business applications. You will not only learn the different theories and algorithms for social data analytics, but also have a chance to apply them to real-world problem solving through in-class lab sessions and course project.

The main programming language used in this lab sessions of the course is Python. Throughout the course, progressively more advanced tools and algorithms for social analytics will be introduced. Students are expected to complete a group project, to demonstrate a set of full-stack abilities from developments to analytics, knowledge discovery, and business applications."
ISSS608,Visual Analytics and Applications,"In this competitive global environment, the ability to explore visual representation of business data interactively and to detect meaningful patterns, trends and exceptions from these data are increasingly becoming an important skill for data analysts and business practitioners.  Drawing from research and practice on Data Visualisation, Human-Computer Interaction, Data Analytics, Data Mining and Usability Engineering, this course aims to share with you how visual analytics techniques can be used to interact with data from various sources and formats, explore relationship, detect the expected and discover the unexpected without having to deal with complex statistical formulas and programming.

The goals of this course are:

  To train you with the basic principles, best practices and methods of interactive data visualisations,

  To provide you hands-on experiences in using commercial off-the-shelf visual analytics software and programming tools to design interactive data visualisations"
ISSS609,Text Analytics and Applications,"Recent advances of technologies have enabled much easier and faster ways to generate and collect data, of which unstructured textual data account for a large proportion, especially on social media. Textual data contain much valuable information for businesses, such as consumer opinions, which can help improve products and services, and users  personal interests, which can guide targeted advertising. However, textual data are inherently different from structured data. How to extract value out of the large amount of unstructured and oftentimes noisy textual data is a challenge many businesses face nowadays.

This course will introduce to the students the fundamental principles behind text analytics algorithms and some of the latest emerging technologies for solving real-world text analytics problems. The course will start with fundamentals of text analytics, including bag-of-word representation, vector space model and basic knowledge of natural language processing. Next, some common tasks in text analytics such as text classification, text clustering and topic modeling will be examined. Finally, information extraction, sentiment analysis and some other advanced topics will be discussed.

Students will acquire knowledge and skills in text analytics through lectures, class discussions, assignments and group projects using real-world datasets."
ISSS611,Process Analytics and Applications,"Many companies are moving towards digital transformation today. Most processes are being supported by systems with certain degree of automation. For example, an order-to-cash process may involve receiving orders on the eCommerce platform. Orders are then routed to supply chain for fulfilment. Multiple steps of approvals may be required to fulfil an order, followed by arrangement of shipments to the customers. Invoices are also digitally captured, and payment received via various online means. In the real-world businesses, processes are highly complex, dynamic (evolving over time) and uncertain (subject to random events and behaviours).

Process analytics is a field of analytics that includes understanding the business processes in an organization, analysing process performances, evaluating the resources consumed and developing improved ones that help organizations operate more efficiently and effectively.  Based on this key principle, this course covers two major topics -- Process Mining and Process Simulation. 

Process Mining is a technique to discover processes and characterise them in process models. Graph modeling and machine learning algorithms are applied to discover business processes from the event execution data. This data-driven technique can provide the ground truth (of the actual execution) rather than relying on an idealized process model. It can also identify the bottlenecks and opportunities for improving the processes. From the process models, we combine the ground truth and expert s view to design the new to-be processes. As the real-world process are typically challenging to be modelled mathematically, simulation becomes the only feasible tool to examine the alternatives. By incorporating the data models from the actual process execution, process simulation helps decision-makers to arrive at evidence-based conclusions by visualizing, analysing and optimizing their processes.

This course covers the Descriptive, Predictive and Prescriptive analytics by modeling and simulating the behaviour of real-world business processes. You will be introduced to both the theoretical background and applications of process mining and simulation. Topics covered include data mining the process events, applying machine learning methods to derive the processes, abstracting real-world process as a digital replica, statistical analysis of the simulation models and introductory concepts of digital twin. The skills and competencies you learned will be applicable to various industries such as manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and many more."
ISSS612,Big Data: Tools and Techniques,"Big Data has become a key consideration when organizations today develop strategic outlook of the consumer and market trends. Big Data sets have become an enabler to organizations in developing strategies and plans to develop compelling product and services and differentiated customer experiences at low cost by optimizing operations and processes. 

Business analytics today increasingly leverages not just the traditional structured data sets to answer business questions, but also the newer forms of Big Data that can help answer new questions or even answer old questions in newer ways. Big Data is helping provide richer and newer insights into questions analytics has been answering by modeling for a richer customer and operations scenario. 

As such, it is incumbent on practitioners of advance analytics to be intimately familiar with technologies that help store, manage and analyze these Big Data streams (sensor data, text data, image data etc.) in an integrated way along with more traditional data sets (e.g. CRM, ERP etc.)

This course is intended to equip students with an appreciation and a working knowledge of Big Data technologies that are prevalent in the market today along with how and when to use Big Data technologies for specific scenarios. This course will provide a foundation to the Hadoop framework (HDFS, MapReduce) along with Hadoop ecosystem components (Pig, Hive, Spark and Kafka). The course will also cover key Big Data architectures from the point of view of both on-premise environments and public cloud deployments."
ISSS615,Data Management,"In the digital age, data is considered as a very valuable resource and one of the most important assets of any organisation. It forms the basis on which an organisation makes decisions. Consequently, we would like the data to be accurate, complete, consistent, and well organized. This course focuses on relational databases, one of the most common approaches adopted by industry to manage structured data. It covers fundamentals of relational database theory, important data management concepts, such as data modelling, database design, implementation, data access, and practical data-related issues in current business information systems.

A series of in-class exercises, tests, pop quizzes, and a course project help students understand the covered topics. Students are expected to apply knowledge learned in the classroom to solve many problems based on real-life business scenarios, while gaining hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and managing database systems."
ISSS616,Applied Statistical Analysis with R,"Recent advances of technologies have enabled more seamless ways of generating and collecting larger volume and variety of data. Applied Statistics is hence the relevant branch of Mathematics that is used to visualize, analyze, interpret, and predict outcomes from these data. Descriptive Statistics will equip us with the basic concepts used for describing data while Inferential Statistics allows us to make inferences and deductions about underlying populations from sample data.

This course spans across a semester and students will acquire knowledge in applying statistical theory for analyzing data as well as the skillsets in statistical computing for developing applications with the R programming language. The first half of each lesson will be dedicated to equipping students with statistical concepts in descriptive and inferential statistics while the second half will be focused on the practical aspects of implementing them within the R console. The course aims to progressively prepare students to eventually develop their very own data application in RStudio, an integrated development environment built for the R programming language."
ISSS620,Analytics Framework & Business Context,"This course sets the stage by introducing the Unified Service Sector Process Framework as well as the Plan-Do-See-Act Framework for the data value chain. The Unified Service Sector process framework is used to represent and analyse a service enterprise in terms of 11 interlocking views. This is illustrated with case studies from healthcare, hospitality, retail, supply chain and others. The Plan-Do-See-Act Framework for the data value chain is used to organize and explain how data is generated, manipulated, analysed and used across key functional areas. The functional areas we focus on are those dealing with customers, operations and IT service delivery. This course lays the foundation for the subsequent series of courses."
ISSS621,Data Science for Business,"This course is aimed to provide both an overview and an in-depth exposition of key topics of data science from the perspective of a data-driven technology-enabled paradigm for business application and innovation.

Moreover, disruptive innovation spring nowadays more often from the engine of big data and the intelligence extracted from them. It is our aim to help students gain a deeper look into data and computation on them, such that

(I) Students learn the state-of-the-art of the data technology at the current frontier, as well as the possibilities to explore future innovations.

(II) Students learn the pitfalls and limitations of what data and computations can do, to gain a technologically-savvy mindset and decision system.

(III) Students understand and learn to evaluate the relevant key factors that interplay in data science from a business perspective."
ISSS622,Python Programming and Data Analysis,"Many real-world businesses require data analysts, data engineers and data scientists to build applications in programming language Python together with the off-the-shelf libraries. Programming in Python becomes fundamental to many businesses and high proficiency in Python programming is essential to job roles like data analysts, data engineers and data scientists.

This course is designed for students who wish to master Python as a programming language and wish to build data analysis solutions with Python and many widely used libraries. This course teaches both the Python programming language itself and how to carry out descriptive and diagnostic data analysis in Python. In the Python programming part, basic topics including data types, containers and control flow will be first introduced. As advanced topics in Python programming, lambda expressions, functions, modules and regular expressions will also be explained and elaborated in great details. In the second part, this course will teach functions in the three important libraries numpy, pandas and matplotlib. With these three libraries, students are then ready to perform descriptive and diagnostic data analysis with data visualization on sample datasets provided by the course instructors. Upon the completion of the course, students should be able to carry out data analysis with Python and related libraries at a high proficient level."
ISSS623,Applied Healthcare Analytics,"The World Health Organization has projected a shortfall of 18 million health workers by 2030. Singapore is facing a similar scenario of healthcare workforce shortfalls, exacerbated by a fast-aging population. In order to future-proof and ensure the continued accessibility, quality and affordability of healthcare, the Singapore government has made three key shifts to move beyond hospital to the community, beyond quality to value, and beyond healthcare to health. In order to achieve this goal, analytics and data science can play a key enabling role to alleviate the increasing burden in our healthcare systems.

Health systems worldwide have embarked on the drive towards digitalization for over the past 20 years. The ability to capture, analyze and synthesize data for high priority and impactful health service delivery and clinical processes is an important precursor to development of efficacious evidence-based interventions. The growth in volume, speed and complexity of healthcare data necessitates the effective use of data analytic tools and techniques to derive insights for improving patient outcomes, ensuring the sustainability of care, improving population health and ensuring the well-being of service providers.

In this course, we will introduce the characteristics of healthcare data and associated data mining challenges. We will cover various algorithms, systems and frameworks to enable the use of healthcare data for the improvement of care outcomes. The focus will be on the application of these knowledge to deal with real-world challenges in healthcare analytic applications across the entire data analytic value chain from data preparation, descriptive, predictive and prescriptive modelling techniques. We will also look at the evaluation of analytic solutions in real-world implementation."
ISSS624,Applied Geospatial Analytics,"Geospatial data and analytics are essential components of the toolkit for decision analysts and managers in the highly uncertain and complex global economy. The global geospatial analytics market was estimated to be nearly USD60 billion in 2020 and projected to grow at a CAGR of more than 10% over 2021-2028. Government and private industry around the world are investing heavily in both the generation of geospatial data, management and analytical systems for the effective translation of geospatial data into useful information and insights for business decision making. Emergent global challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, has also brought about an unprecedented surge in the demand for geospatial analytics talents.

ISSS625,Query Processing and Optimisation,"This course aims to educate students on techniques for writing more efficient, less resource-intensive, and   in a consequence   faster database query statements. Such queries are more suitable for application in real-world environments, such as production databases with a high volume of parallel requests, environments executing repeated queries at short intervals, or big data processing systems. To do so, the course discusses operations executed by databases to process queries, performance cost of executing certain queries, and examines the impact that code of similar queries expressed through different statements has on database response times.

This course exposes students to selected techniques they can apply to assess and change performance characteristics of database queries. These techniques include special statements for analysing query execution plans, application of structural optimisations (selection of data types, normalisation, various types of indexes, different forms of partitioning, etc.), and application of behavioral optimisations (with focus on complex queries using joins, or subqueries). To cover a wide variety of scenarios, the course includes a classic relational database MySQL/MariaDB, a data warehouse software Apache Hive, as well as a document-oriented NoSQL database MongoDB."
LAW4009,Chinas BRI: Practical Legal and Commercial Aspects of Cross-Border Projects on the New Silk Route,"China s controversial Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is an extraordinarily ambitious program for infrastructure investment and development across the globe. It has continuously evolved since its launch in 2013 with a complex array of initiatives. It has changed the markets in which it invests and the broader infrastructure and project finance market overall.

The course is based on practical experience in working on BRI projects. It will look at antecedents to the BRI, and then look at the evolving policy, legal and commercial framework for BRI projects from the perspective of both China and the broader market. Particular focus will also be paid to the investment and financing structures for BRI projects and the impact of the BRI."
LAW4025,Overseas Project Experience (Law in Asia),"With its rising economic clout, Asia has become a magnet for firms from around the world.  While the ever-expanding Asian market provides endless opportunities, many businesses find that the Asian legal systems present a big challenge to their investment in or trade with Asian countries.  Deeply influenced by diverse legal traditions, Asian legal systems that exist today also bears heavy marks left by the Civil Law system, the Socialist ideology, as well as the Common Law system in its commercial law.  Thus, the Asian legal systems appear unique and complicated.  This course aims to help the students to gain an insider s perspective of one of the most important nations in the world today, with a special emphasis on its legal systems.  In addition to the doctrinal studies on key areas in the Asian legal systems, the course, under the Overseas Project Experience (Law in Asia) model, will also expose the students to its practical operations through project-based consultancy with our Asian partners and a week-long field trip in a particular Asian jurisdiction.  Through this course, the students will not only grasp the basic contours of the Asian legal systems, but also gain hands-on experience by working with Asian legal practitioners to solve real-world legal issues."
LAW404,Public International Law,"This course offers students an introduction to the international legal order (the actors, the institutions, and the rules) and its evolution. This course will first equip students with skills to identify rules of international law through discussions about sources of international law, and the tools to interpret such norms. Importantly, given the nebulous nature of certain areas of international law, students will learn to craft arguments advocating for or against the existence of certain international rules. This course will also cover certain foundational areas of international law, such as that of jurisdiction (when a court/tribunal can hear a dispute) and state responsibility (when a state is responsible for an act or omission). Following which, this course will narrow in on specific substantive areas of international law, where students will be exposed to the rules and unique challenges in these fields.

By the end of this course, students should be able to effectively analyze public international law issues using legal tools, taking into account policy considerations, and with an understanding of how public international law is changing."
LAW410,World Trade Organization: Law and Policy,"While rather young compared to other international organizations, the World Trade Organization (WTO) has quickly become the most important international organization for business firms across the globe. Its ever expansive rules now cover issues including trade in both industrial and agricultural products, trade in services, labor mobility, investment, free trade agreements, health and food safety, and a wide variety of domestic regulatory regimes. Thus, it is important that lawyers advising business firms understand these rules so they may help the clients to structure their transactions to maximize their benefits and minimize the costs.

This course will help the students to study the legal rules of the WTO, which cover tariff measures, antidumping and safeguard measures, food safety regulations, as well as domestic regulatory requirements. Using real WTO cases decided by the WTO tribunals as examples, the students will be able to critically examine how these rules are made, what are the impacts on business firms, how to argue the best case for their clients, and how these rules could be improved in the future. Taught by a former WTO staff member who is among a handful of people in the world who has worked on WTO cases at both Panel and Appellate Body levels as an insider, the students will also gain valuable insight into the WTO dispute settlement process, which arguably is the most important international tribunal in the world today.

The knowledge and skills learnt in this course will be helpful for students to explore a wide range of career options, including private law firms, government agencies (MFA, MTI), multinational companies, and international organizations (WTO, World Bank)."
LAW419,International and Comparative Criminal Justice,"This course explores the growing internationalisation of criminal justice as a phenomenon of global governance. It will examine the various institutional and process responses to international crimes and their relation to international human rights and access to justice. It will consider the different paradigms of justice that inform diverse international developments, notably contrasts between retributive and restorative justice. The course will investigate tensions and conflicts between nation-state based criminal justice and international norms, processes and procedures for regulating crime. It will assess the extent to which a distinct international criminal justice order is being established, the nature of its jurisprudence and values and its implications.

Further, it will offer students an understanding of criminal justice that is sensitive to debates about globalisation, policy transfer in comparative as well as international contexts. It will explore the nature of trans-national crimes and responses that seek the governance of global risk/security priorities, including financial crime and international terrorism. The course will analyse the role of the international criminal courts (and tribunals) and the different models of justice implied in competing international justice developments. In particular it will focus on debates between punitive and restorative justice principles from the perspective of legitimate victim interests.

This unit aims to provide students with knowledge of:

1. the growing internationalisation of criminal justice through the establishment of international institutions for regulating transnational crime,
2. the development of alternative justice processes across the globe, and
3. international co-operation and supra-national developments in areas of criminal justice policies and practices."
LAW438,Law Study Mission to Asia,"Businesses do not operate in a vacuum but in a social, economic, and legal context. The legal environment is particularly important given the fact that substantial economic value is captured by contracts as well as a range of intellectual property rights, and credible enforcement of such contractual and property rights have significant impacts on management and entrepreneurship decisions. The aim is to provide a contextual examination and deeper understanding of law-making, judicial institutions, legal practice and law-related bodies in that country and how they relate to the conduct of business. Through the LSM the student is expected to gain an appreciation of the formation, practice and application of law, and the legal institutions and culture in their wider business context within the foreign system. The LSM aims to expose students to these aspects when they visit and engage in participant observation and interviews of firms, legal institutions and businesses overseas as well as stakeholders, including governmental agencies. The purpose of the course includes exposure to the most critical issues of international business and entrepreneurship in the city that is part of the study mission."
LAW472,Information & Communication Technology and Law: Transactions,"Students taking this course will examine the legal issues and solutions arising from transactions through the use of digital information, goods and services as well as via non-physical - analog and digital - channels of communication and delivery. The technological developments from Web 1.0 to 2.0 and the future of Web 3.0 with its impact on human interaction and B2B/B2C commerce as well as e-governance will be examined in the context of civil and criminal law, both in the relevance of old laws and the enactment of new ones. In particular, this course examines the laws specifically arising from and relating to electronic transactions and interaction and their objectives and impact on the individual vis- -vis other parties.

Students will be taken through the policy considerations and general Singapore legislations and judicial decisions on the subject with comparisons and reference to foreign legislation where relevant. In particular, electronic commerce and other forms of transactions will be studied with reference to the Electronic Transactions Act (2010); personal data privacy and protection will be studied with reference to the Personal Data Protection Act of 2012 and the Spam Control Act; the challenges and changes to tort law to deal with online tortious conduct will be analysed (e.g. cyber-harassment and online defamation), and the rights and liabilities relating to personal uses of Internet content and user-generated content will also be considered.

With the recent restructuring of the IDA and MDA into the Infocommunications Media Development Authority (IMDA( and the Government Technology Organisation (GTO) by the MCI as well as the policy plans for Singapore as a digital hub, students will also look at the laws governing broadcast and telecommunications content regulation, in particular the regulation of Internet and Broadcast content will be considered against the suite of legislation and guidelines promulgated by these entities."
LAW473,Information & Communication Technology and Law: Intermediaries,"Students taking this course will examine the legal issues and solutions arising from transactions through the use of digital information, goods and services as well as via non-physical - analog and digital - channels of communication and delivery. The technological developments from Web 1.0 to 2.0 and the future of Web 3.0 have led to new economies and economic models of transaction and governance. B2B/B2C commerce and e-governance have emerged with new players, in the form of Internet intermediaries, taking on a major role as facilitators of commercial and non-commercial transactions online. These include social networking platforms (e.g. Facebook and Twitter), multimedia sharing platforms (e.g. YouTube, Apple Music, Spotify), search engines and news aggregators (e.g. Yahoo and Google), content hosts and storage facilities (e.g. Dropbox and Bittorrent) and many others.

Laws have been adapted to deal with the roles and functions of such intermediaries and in particular, different jurisdictions are faced with the challenge to manage the new economy and players, and to balance the interest of multiple parties, in the context of areas of law including intellectual property, data protection, privacy and cyber-security. Different types of safe harbor laws and exceptions have emerged to protect these intermediaries, while some forms of protections have been augmented to protect the interests of other parties including content providers and creators as well as society at large.

Students will be taken through the policy considerations and general Singapore legislations and judicial decisions on the subject with comparisons and reference to foreign legislation where relevant, especially where comparative analysis is important to the understanding of the global regime and trends, and to the interpretation of the local provisions that have an impact on intermediaries.

An important and unique component of this course will be the case studies and role-playing that teams will be assigned to play in applying the laws and regulations in giving advice to a client that will be a hypothetical or real intermediary of the type mentioned above."
LAW481,International Mediation Law and Practice,"This course deals with the rapidly growing area of private international mediation and multi-tiered dispute resolution processes that have mediation as an element. It offers participants a framework for understanding cross-border law and practice in this field.

Imagine the following scenario: A Singaporean mediator is asked to mediate a professional negligence dispute.  The plaintiff is based in Indonesia, the defendant accounting firm is in the Netherlands, and the defendant s insurer has its headquarters in the United States.  All agree to attend mediation in Singapore. The preliminary discussions and meetings, however, take place via email and video-conference with all parties in their home countries.  The mediation occurs and the parties reach a settlement, which the parties  legal representatives draft into contractual form.

Such cross-border mediations involve:
  international and intercultural competencies;
  online and face-to-face mediation protocols; and
  knowledge of private international law in relation to the substantive and procedural aspects of mediation.

The course will address these and other topical issues, including enforceability of international mediated settlement agreements, to provide participants with a current overview of international legal practice and trends in this field.  Participants will have the opportunity to develop specialised mediation skills relevant to cross-border settings."
LAW485,Intellectual Property and International Trade,"This course examines the international intellectual property system and addresses the legal issues raised by the trade of products protected by intellectual property rights (patents, trademarks, and copyrights) across different jurisdictions. This course reviews the key international agreements and provisions in this area, as well as the different national policies, which have been adopted, to date, in several domestic jurisdictions or free trade areas, including the European Union, the U.S., China, Japan, and the ASEAN countries.

By the conclusion of the course, students are expected to: 1) master the basic concepts, issues and rules of Intellectual Property Law and its relationship with international trade; 2) master the reading, interpretation, and application of the relevant International and domestic statutes and leading cases; 3) understand the underlying public policies and economic concepts; 4) identify legal issues, apply relevant legal principles, and generate solutions to legal problems arising in relevant factual contexts."
LAW486,Privacy and Data Protection Law,"In the information age, the production and management of data will define the future of governance and businesses. The  data economy  renders digitized information - promulgating at ever increasing speed   a valuable asset through the use of data analytics. It has also led to a fundamental shift in power and markets. The emergence of disruptive technological and business innovations is one prominent example of such a change. New economies are formed, such as from the use of artificial intelligence (AI), the development of  cognitive services , the digitization of goods and the provision of storage/sharing and management services. Governments, including the Singapore public sector, are also aware of the importance of data to governance and to the future of the economy and are driving innovations and technology usage within that sector as well as in society generally through the Smart Nation initiative and Digital Economy drive. Substantial research and development are also encouraged in this field.

These fundamental shifts also lead to many problems and challenges related to different types of data and data sets. For Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) and the data economy generally, cybersecurity is a major concern. In relation to personal data and digital communications, there are various threats to different forms of privacy. Other current issues surrounding data are the  fake news  phenomenon and the persistent threats to intellectual property. On the flipside, these developments have also led to new industries (and careers) such as in the areas of cybersecurity and data protection.

The objective of this course is to prepare students who are interested in data protection law and may have an interest in making a career in this nascent industry that is set to grow. Students will first be introduced to the data economy as a concept and to the real changes to the market and to society as well as the various forms and categorisations of data and the legal aspects to these data sets. The second part of the course will then focus on privacy law and its relationship with data protection (DP) law. In this context, comparative study will be made of privacy and DP regimes of significance (e.g. OECD, EU, APEC, etc.). Third, students will then focus their study on the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (and other relevant laws)   in particular, the data protection and do not call provisions - by looking at its history, objective, scope/application and possible future developments e.g. Data Protection Ecosystem and PDPA Act Review. Comparative study of similar concepts and processes in other jurisdictions will also be assessed in the course of the study of the Singapore PDPA. The fundamental concepts and workings of the PDPA will be examined in depth. In the fourth part of the course, practitioners from the PDPC and the private sector will provide their perspectives on this process and a holistic and practical viewpoint to the study.

After completing this course, students will be able to use what they have learnt to obtain professional certification such as from the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) and PDPC with a view to practice in this area as a privacy counsel, privacy professional, manager and/or technologist. This will prepare students for a career in this growing field, or at least provide them with the skills and knowledge when dealing with such issues as a TMT lawyer, legal counsel or even as a general legal practitioner that will possibly encounter these issues at work."
LAW489,Introduction to Law and Technology,"The goal of the course is to provide a broad appreciation for the intersection of emerging technologies and the law.
Often times there is not enough (or even any) law that adequately regulates a particular area.  In some instances, the courts can apply regulations and laws from similar technologies as a stopgap.    This course aims to show where the law adequately regulates an emerging technology and where there is room for improvement.
The course aims to have an international bent, looking at how different regimes apply their laws and how those efforts promote or stymie innovation. 
This is a short course and it is impossible to provide even a cursory overview of all interesting and emerging technologies.  As such, this syllabus is only a guideline for potential analysis and discussion.  We will look to the students to decide what areas in particular interest them and the class will try to focus there."
LAW491,Law and Digital Commerce,"As businesses increasingly embrace the use of technology in domestic and cross-border operations, such as blockchain technology, cloud technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) and digitalized trade documents, it is necessary for lawyers and legal policy-makers to not only appreciate the complex legal and policy issues arising from such use of technology, but to also help provide clear legal thinking and innovative ideas in resolving such issues.

This unique course aims to provide students with an opportunity to learn about and confront a selection of such issues, develop an understanding of real-world legal-policy issues and exercise skills in critical thinking and creativity to produce usable law and policy recommendations. The issues are selected based on their topicality, feedback from industry, importance to Singapore and ASEAN and a review of academic and business literature.

Students will be guided in an exploration and analysis of cross-border trade law issues relating to the intersection of commerce and technology. In the first part of the course, an explanation of the some key issues will be provided to help students understand the broader context of trade in the digital economy. Students will then be exposed to a number of issues which are confronting policy-makers and the private sector, so that they may conduct legal research and craft clear and cogent law and policy recommendations from their findings. Industry professionals will help to provide feedback and discuss students  findings and recommendations. Industry contacts in this course are likely to be from the fields of finance, technology, commerce, policy/strategy and law.

In addition to interactive learning with the course instructor (Professor Locknie Hsu), students will also receive industry and policy insights from 1-3 industry experts (who may be from the commerce and finance, technology and/or policy-making sectors)."
LAW493,Intellectual Property Law and Competition Law at Interplay,"One of the hottest legal topics in the knowledge economy is surely the conflict between intellectual property law and competition law and its resolution. The fact that the patent licensing practice of Qualcomm (world no. 1 chip designer in mobile communication) has been challenged world over is an attestation in point. So is the antitrust suit against Google, and previously against Microsoft, Intel and many other IP giants. To provide a systemic solution to this conflict is the goal of this module. It will start with a detailed discussion of the general theory of IP laws and try to establish common principles applicable to all areas of IP. It will then introduce the competition law regimes on cartel, abuse of dominance and unfair competition, before it embarks on to examine  compulsory license of IP, exhaustion of IP,  resale price maintenance agreement  on IP protected protects, and the issuance of warning letters, which encompass all IP laws. The module will further break down to analyze the relationship between competition law and the exercise of specific IP rights, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, design rights, plant variety rights, and eventually also  trade secrets."
LAW101_601,Contract Law 1,"Contracts are the foundation of commercial life.  This course aims to equip students with a firm appreciation of the unique character of contracts as a form of voluntary undertakings. This course begins by examining the concepts relating to the formation of contract, as well as how an otherwise validly formed contract may have its effect nullified by issues such as misrepresentation, duress, undue influence, etc. Contract Law 1 will be followed in the second semester by LAW102 Contract Law 2 which will go on to look at issues relating to how a contract may be discharged, what sort of remedies are available when a contractual obligation is breached, as well as certain issues relating to contracts for the sale of goods. Over the two courses, the student will be sensitized to the role of the law in facilitating commerce, respecting legitimate expectations, and guarding against unfair exploitation of economic or social weakness. The study of the subject will also provide students with an excellent opportunity to observe, evaluate and critique developments in the law as it responds to the fast-changing and dynamic environment of the world of commerce."
LAW102_602,Contract Law 2,"This course builds on the foundational knowledge in LAW101 Contract Law 1 and aims to equip students with a firm appreciation of the unique character of contracts as a form of voluntary undertaking. By examining the concepts relating to mistake, misrepresentation, non-disclosure, duress, undue influence, unconscionability, illegality, formalities, capacity, privity, and remedies for breach of contract, the student will be sensitized to the role of the law in facilitating commerce, respecting legitimate expectations, and guarding against unfair exploitation of economic or social weakness, in the context of paper-based as well as electronic commerce contracts. It will, in particular, introduce students to the use of technology which impacts business and consumer contracts, and the applicability of contract law rules in such situations.

The study of the subject will provide students with an excellent opportunity to observe, evaluate and critique developments in the law in response to the dynamic environment of commerce."
LAW103_603,Criminal Law,"This course will introduce students to the basic principles and various aspects of criminal law. The criminal law in Singapore is contained in the Penal Code (Cap. 224) and provisions in other statutes. Case law interpreting and applying the elements and provisions of the various offences will also be examined. The student will first approach criminal law from a jurisprudential viewpoint and consider its objectives, functions and theoretical basis. A greater part of the course will be spent examining the various substantive areas of criminal law."
LAW105_605,Law of Torts,"This course will discuss general principles of tort law as well as covering a selected number of torts in greater depth. The goals and objectives of tort law will be examined in the context of the relationship between torts, contract, criminal law and property law. There will be emphasis placed on the different range of interests protected by torts (property, economic, personal etc) and the need to achieve a proper balance between competing interests. Different classification systems for torts will be examined: by interest, by the nature of the interference (intention, recklessness, carelessness, strict liability) and by whether consequential harm is needed (torts actionable per se). One goal will be to demonstrate the dynamic nature of law and its development to meet changing social and economic conditions. Before an examination of the various torts, the students will learn about the internal classification of torts and the relationship of the law of torts to other legal obligations."
LAW106_606,Legal Research and Writing I,"The objective of this course is to develop skills in practical legal research, writing and drafting, interviewing and advising and advocacy in first-year students. These skills will be taught in the context of legal problems in contract law, criminal law, and the law of torts, previously covered or concurrently taught in the first year."
LAW107_607,Legal Research and Writing II,"The objective of this course is to develop skills in practical legal research, writing and drafting, interviewing and advising and advocacy in first-year students. These skills will be taught in the context of legal problems in contract law, criminal law, and the law of torts, previously covered or concurrently taught in the first year."
LAW108_608,The Singapore Legal System,"Singapore belongs to the common law tradition, given its English colonial heritage. Many aspects of the legal system are thus derived from the English system. It is important to realise, though, that Singapore s legal system and that of its constituent laws are not mere offshoots of the English. Many substantive and institutional features as well as rules and practices within the system have changed over time.

Broadly speaking, topics include Singapore s legal history, the sources of law in Singapore,  constitutional and institutional framework of the Singapore State, disruptions to and the regulation of the legal sector. Time permitting, a trip to a State institution may be organised.

The main objectives of the course are, firstly, to familiarise students to various key aspects of the Singapore legal system; and, secondly, to equip candidates with a set of fundamental legal knowledge to springboard to other courses within the core curriculum."
LAW109_609,Comparative Legal Systems,"This course will examine the various legal cultures and traditions within Asia. The historical background of these traditions in Asia including the Western and colonialist (and post-colonialist) influences will also be explored. In this increasingly globalised economy, the lawyer needs to be conversant with the legal traditions and cultures of Asia especially that of Southeast Asia, India and China."
LAW201_621,Corporate Law,"Singapore law recognises that there are many ways one can organise commercial activities with a view to maximising operational efficiency and minimising exposure to personal risk.  These diverse mechanisms, ranging from agency, partnerships, bodies corporate and the business trust and other unincorporated bodies form the core of this course s content."
LAW202_622,Law of Property,"This course aims to introduce students to the basic principles of common law and equity as applied to property, both immoveable and moveable including intellectual property. Beginning with an exploration of what ownership of land means, this course will consider how land can be dealt with at common law and in equity, before taking a look at how some of these complexities have receded, given the adoption and universal application of the Torrens registration system in Singapore. In the middle part of this course, the question of ownership and transfer of moveable property at common law and in equity will be considered with particular attention to the difficulties posed by intangible moveable property in the form of intellectual property rights as well as other choices in action. The final part of the course examines the creation of security interests over immoveable and moveable property and the problems relating to determining the priorities of competing security interests. Comparisons may be drawn with alternative systems of property law, e.g. the scheme of security interests set out in the Uniform Commercial Code and the treatment of property generally in the American Restatement on Property."
LAW203_623,Comparative Legal Systems,"This course will examine the various legal cultures and traditions within Asia. The historical background of these traditions in Asia including the Western and colonialist (and post-colonialist) influences will also be explored. In this increasingly globalised economy, the lawyer needs to be conversant with the legal traditions and cultures of Asia especially that of Southeast Asia, India and China."
LAW204_624,Constitutional & Administrative Law,"This course introduces the principles of constitutional law and administrative law. Constitutional law is concerned with the organisation of the state, the inter-relationship between the government, civil society, and the individual. Administrative law is about the governance of public bodies exercising statutory or other powers or performing public duties. This course is generally concerned with how law, institutions and norms promote good governance, how political power and public law functions are legitimated, how abuses of public power are prevented or remedied, and the relationship between the individual and the state."
LAW301_631,Legal Theory & Philosophy,"The course aims to provide an introduction to the underlying philosophies and theories for the existence of a legal system and its laws, the interaction between Law and other disciplines such as Ethics, Society and Business, the different perspectives and approaches to the Law as well as specific topics on Asian Values and Adjudication. The application of the various jurisprudential theories will be illustrated through local legislation such as the Women s Charter."
LAW302_632,Commercial Conflict of Laws,"This course serves as an introduction and overview of fundamental principles of Conflict of Laws. In this modern age, when cross-border commerce is the norm, the parties in a commercial relationship may reside in or be registered in different countries, and the negotiation, drafting, conclusion and performance of a contract can be conducted in different jurisdictions. The course introduces and explains the fundamental principles of Conflict of Laws. When problems arise in the relationship or transaction and the parties seek to resolve their disputes, the conflict of laws addresses four large issues: (1) when will a Singapore court exercise jurisdiction to adjudicate? (2) What can a Singapore court be asked to do to prevent a foreign court from adjudicating? (3) When will a Singapore court apply something other than the domestic law of Singapore to determine the claim? And (4) what effect will a foreign judgment have in Singapore? Given the cross-border nature of the issues, the position in other jurisdictions (for example, the applicable rules in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States) will also be considered for the purposes of comparison with Singapore law."
LAW303_633,Law of Equity & Trusts,"As the common law developed the institution of the contract, the courts of equity gave rise to the institution of the trust. Combining elements of proprietary right, obligation and institution, the trust is a flexible and essential concept for the legal professional to master. The objective of this course is to introduce students to the jurisdiction and principles of equity originally developed by the courts of equity, and which are now applied and implemented within our ""fused"" system of common law and equity.  Students will be acquainted with the historical development of equity in England, as well as modern-day developments and application of equitable concepts, institutions and remedies in various jurisdictions such as in Australia and Canada. Selected developments in equity by the Australian and Canadian courts will be compared with the position in England and Singapore."
LAW306,Law of Evidence & Civil Procedure,"In every trial, the trial judge is faced with two distinct challenges. First, the trial judge must make findings of fact, which is to say, the judge has to decide what happened. Secondly, based on these facts, the trial judge applies the relevant substantive legal rules to the dispute before coming to his reasoned decision. The Law of Evidence is concerned with the rules, theories and policies underlying the heavy responsibility of the trial judge in relation to the first question. This area of the law is concerned with the issues of admissibility of evidence, modes of proof, the manner of production of evidence, and the standard and burden of proof.  In the final part of this course, the students will also be acquainted with civil procedure."
LAW307_637,Law of Evidence,"The Law of Evidence is primarily concerned with the Evidence Act's conceptualisation of relevance and admissibility of evidence in Singapore. ""Exclusionary"" rules such as hearsay, similar fact, and expert opinion will be explored. Other topics include standard and burden of proof, privilege, and statements. The relationship between the Evidence Act and the common law, as well as certain features of Singapore's justice system, are key themes."
LAW400,Directed Research,"To apply to do a Directed Research (DR) paper, students must have completed and passed the second year of LL.B. studies. In addition, students must have obtained a cumulative GPA of 3.30 or better. Applications to do a second DR will be considered on a case-by-case basis. A student who wishes to undertake a second DR must have already successfully completed the first DR and must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.30 or better at the time of application for the second DR."
LAW401,Intellectual Property Law,"It is a truism that the world has entered the information age where knowledge and new ideas will form the bedrock of the new economic order.

This course has the aim of setting out an overview of the rationale and principles governing protection of core intellectual and industrial property rights: copyright; patents; passing off and registered trade marks.

The course will be concerned not just with domestic  black letter  intellectual property law in Singapore. It will also examine international concerns and the growing importance of intellectual property in the context of international trade.

One of the central themes of this course will be the question:  is it possible that we now have too much of a good thing and that the world is now sated and nearing IP indigestion ?"
LAW402,Chinese Contract Law,"This course will provide students with a comparative perspective on selected issues in contract law. It will compare the main principles of contract at common law and those in Chinese law. It will also examine the Chinese contract law perspectives relating to the scope of application, judicial interpretation, formation, performance, modification and assignment of contracts as well as liability for breach of contract. At the end of the course, students will be able to understand the Chinese contract law framework and appreciate the differences between common law and Chinese law."
LAW403,Negotiation and Mediation for Lawyers,"Negotiation forms a large part of what lawyers do. The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to negotiation and mediation in practice. This course pursues two parallel tracks of inquiry:

First, the course will examine the development and role of alternatives to litigation in the last three decades, and will in particular consider the arguments for and against extra-judicial processes of dispute resolution. This aspect of the course will also examine, on a comparative basis, the manner in which legislatures and the judiciary have responded to the growth of negotiation and mediation, especially in developing such processes as judicial settlement conferences, judge-led or court-annexed mediation, restorative justice, the statutory provision for mediation, and judicial  supervision  of private justice;

Second, the course will provide an introduction to the core skills and processes of negotiation and mediation, in particular paying attention to the practice of mutual gains bargaining and negotiating in the international legal environment. These skills of negotiation and mediation may be identified as encompassing dispute analysis, dispute management, bargaining, problem solving, effective communication, and relationship-building skills"
LAW405,Information Technology and the Law,"Information Technology is the use of technology to manage and process information. It involves the development and use of computer hardware and software for every aspect of the  life  of information, goods and services as well as the  process  of communication. As technology develops and changes, new challenges emerge for law and policy-makers to deal with the impact that they may have on society. Existing laws have to adapt to the digital medium and subject matter, and in some cases entirely new areas of law are crafted. This course on Information Technology and the Law examines the legal issues and regulations arising out of the use of information technology in major areas of law, such as electronic contracting in e-commerce, intellectual property rights on the Internet, the domain name regime, data protection and privacy rights in relation to electronic information, torts committed online, content regulation, computer crimes and cybercrime."
LAW406,International Commercial Arbitration,"International commercial arbitration has held itself out to be a fast, convenient and confidential means of binding dispute resolution. Since 1958, the wide spread recognition of arbitration awards by different countries, the promulgation of a model law of arbitration and a growing acceptance of a uniform set of best practices has increased the profile of arbitration. This is more so in Asia than anywhere else. In a region of varied court systems, arbitration offers certainty, due process, confidentiality and a quiet resolution. Or does it?

As arbitration is consensual, almost all arbitrations arise from a clause in an agreement. The agreement itself can address a myriad of dealings from joint ventures to distributorships to acquisitions. Lawyers in all commercial disciplines need to appreciate what their clients agree to when an arbitration clause is in their document.

The course is a study of the core principles applicable to international commercial arbitration, the main international rules and of the values adopted by Singapore in its efforts to become an international commercial arbitration centre."
LAW407,Complex International Litigation,"The intention will be to examine the theory and practice, with more attention on the latter, of cross-border litigation. The difference between it and a more ordinary course on international commercial litigation (or between it and the ICL component of a course on the commercial conflict of laws) is that it will try to examine the practical consequences of the rules and the strategic opportunities which are available. The intention will be to take a complex case - maybe accountant or auditor negligence, maybe engineering disaster or pharmaceutical catastrophe - and look at the way it may evolve when the various interested parties (or their insurers) have divergent views about what litigation should take place, where it should take place, what may be done to stymie litigation in other places, and so forth: it will therefore examine law, procedure, and tactics. It will in part be done by reference to pleadings and skeleton arguments which will be drafted specially for the purpose. In the first year of its being offered, the course will be available only to final-year students who have completed the course on Commercial Conflict of Laws."
LAW408,Chinese Foreign Investment Law,"The course will introduce law students to China's rationale and approach to foreign direct investment, the main FDI forms in China including the laws and the relevant legislations governing these forms, such as equity joint ventures, contractual joint ventures, wholly foreign-owned enterprises, limited liability companies as well as Mergers & Acquisitions in China. It will provide law students with a critical, accurate and updated understanding of the FDI regime as well as the relationship between the FDI governing laws and other general laws."
LAW409,"Law of Confidential Information, Trade Secrets and Privacy","This course examines the extent to which the law protects confidential information. Not just confidential commercial information and trade secrets but also the way in which the law has developed internationally to provide better protection for personal or private information. Aside from gaining knowledge in this very important area of the law, this course will help reinforce your understanding of how the common law develops and the interaction between policy considerations and judicial law making."
LAW411,Corporate Crime,"This course will provide students with knowledge of major business or corporate crimes. Students will learn to appreciate the delicate balance which needs to be maintained between sustaining robust corporate activities and ensuring corporate integrity and good governance through sufficient regulation. 

Crimes are taking place in the business or corporate world with greater frequency. Knowledge of such crimes is, therefore, becoming increasingly important for all professionals.  This course will provide students with sufficient knowledge of the characteristics of major corporate crimes such as criminal breach of trust, company fraud, corruption, insider trading, cyber crime, money laundering and terrorist financing, the reasons for their occurrence and the work of the regulatory, investigating and prosecuting agencies.  It will also examine the role of the State in regulating corporate behaviour and current methods of crime control including international initiatives."
LAW412,Islamic Commercial Law,"More than   of the world s population is Muslim, including roughly 195 million Muslims in Indonesia, 16 million Muslims in Malaysia, and 439 million Muslims in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Increasingly important in the commercial life of even purely secular countries, Islamic finance world-wide is enjoying an annual growth rate estimated conservatively between 15 20% (assets under management by Islamic financial institutions are estimated to be growing annually as much as 25% and even 40% in some locations). Islamic law has long been overlooked in traditional legal curricula yet it is increasingly important for practicing lawyers to have a basic familiarity with its commercial concepts, as a complement to common law and civil code systems. This subject is an introduction for law students to the primary sources of Islamic law (Shar ah), Islamic commercial jurisprudence (fiqh al-mu malah), and jurisprudential methodology in Islam (us l al-fiqh); legal interpretation and analysis through the methodology of ijtih d, and concepts of qiy s,  illah, istihs n, and masl hah; Islamic law of contracts, including sales contracts (e.g. bai  al-salam, bai  al-inah, bai  al-istisn ) and partnerships used in commercial transactions (mud rabah and mush rakah); and the Islamic waqf."
LAW413,Banking Law,"The law of banking is a topic of fundamental importance in market economies. Banks as providers of deposit and savings accounts, payment mechanisms, and finance are crucial to all sectors of commerce. A significant sector of the legal profession provides advice to the banking industry and this course will be helpful to those seeking to work in that sector.

The initial part of the course will focus upon the duties and obligations of banks and their customers, in particular, in respect of payment methods. In this context there will be an analysis of those legal principles which enable a bank (or its customer) to recover mistaken payments, as well as an examination of the bank's liability for the fraudulent activities of third parties. More generally, there will be a consideration of the bank s responsibility as a fiduciary and its duty of confidentiality to its customer.

The second part of the course will then be devoted to the pivotal role of the bank as a finance provider. There will be a consideration of different types of loan, together with legal mechanisms that are available, or may be utilised, to secure their repayment  (for example, guarantees, set-offs, security over receivables and liens). Particular emphasis will be placed on problems of drafting. Attention will also be given to the bank's role in financing international trade through performance bonds and letters of credit."
LAW414,International Commercialisation of Intellectual Property Rights,"This course will examine different ways in which value may be extracted from the ownership of intellectual property rights (IPRs).  We will start with an overview of the various IPRs around the world and the more important differences between particular countries, which are important when considering an international IP strategy.  The course will then turn to look at different ways of dealing with IPRs: assignment or sale, licensing, and joint ventures; and the different challenges they present.  We will look in detail at the provisions to be included in assignments and licence agreements of the different IPRs.  After that, we will look at how to conduct IP due diligence in corporate transactions, what to look for and how to negotiate the documentation.  After that, IP issues in the IT industry will be discussed, as well as those you will come across in relation to using the Internet or setting up an Internet-based business.  Finally, we will consider how the enforcement of IPRs plays a critical role in extracting value."
LAW415,International Patent Law and Policy,"This course will provide an introduction to key aspects of the international patent system and the myriad policies at play in ongoing global patent harmonization conflicts. The value of patents is increasing in many areas while at the same time the scope of patent-eligible subject matter is expanding.  We will explore the impact of these forces in the creation of international agreements concerning patents, such as the Paris Convention, Patent Cooperation Treaty, the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property, and various bilateral agreements.  Against the backdrop of the U.S patent system, we also will consider the importance of regional patent systems such as the European Patent Convention, as well as the systems of other significant patent players, such as Japan and China. We will also look at controversies in areas such as access to medicines, morally controversial biotech inventions, and computer-implemented inventions.  These and other topics will introduce students to the basics of international and comparative patent law and provide a basis for critical evaluations of the desirability of ever-increasing levels of patent protection on a global scale."
LAW416,International Moots 1,"This is the course to take if students are interested in representing SMU in the best international moot competitions. It will be an intensive course held over half of the first semester, and admission is by approval of the course convenor only. This course exposes students to advanced legal research, writing and appellate advocacy skills. Students will be given a hypothetical moot problem on international law and will have to make oral and written submissions by the end of the course. Those who excel in this course will be selected to participate in moot competitions in the second semester."
LAW417,Law of Mergers and Acquisitions,"This course is designed to provide an overview of the regulation and practice of mergers and acquisitions transactions in Singapore. Where relevant, comparisons with other jurisdictions such as United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Hong Kong will be made. The topics that would be covered include mechanics of structuring mergers and acquisitions transactions, the preparatory work that is required in connection therewith, the regulatory environment in which mergers and acquisitions take place, duties of participants engaged in mergers and acquisitions (including legal advisers, financial advisers and directors of acquirers and target companies), deal protections, deal tactics for friendly and hostile bids, disclosure obligations, competition issues, compulsory acquisitions and financing.

Case studies, adapted from real life examples, will be used extensively in the course."
LAW418,Insurance Law,"The objective of this course is to understand laws regarding insurance contract, insurance companies and the insurance market. Insurance is an integral part of people s daily life and insurance companies are important participants in the financial market. The purposes of this course are two-folds: (1) this course will introduce certain special rules regarding insurance contracts (based on the general contract law), e.g. insurable interests and duty of utmost good faith; and (2) this course will introduce the regulation of insurance companies and insurance agents. After this course, students should be able to make arguments regarding insurance policies on behalf of an insured or an insurance company and to identify regulatory issues regarding the operation and risk management of insurance business. The course will primarily focus on Singapore law; but comparisons will be made from time to time to the laws of other countries."
LAW421,Law of Corporate Finance,"This course would cover the techniques used by corporates to raise funds and the key legal issues that affect borrowers and lenders. Sub-topics under this course include the following:

- Overview of bank lending (including what constitutes syndicated lending, the key legal issues for lenders and how these are addressed through the main documents etc)

- Fund-raising in the capital markets (to some degree, the content here would overlap with that covered in a course on securities regulations but would also cover the use of trusts in common law capital markets transactions, the key legal issues and risks). In this context, the complicated debt securities such as CDOs, structured products, securitisations etc can be covered.

- Risk management   this is an important aspect of financing these days. The crisis has shown that little attention was paid to how banks monitor and regulate their exposures. In this context, there can be interesting discussions on post-crisis regulations, derivative products, issues such as capital adequacy for banks etc."
LAW422,Trade and Investment Law,"Singapore is a centre of trade and investment. The fields of international trade and investment law are intertwined, and an understanding of the law, trade and investment barriers, practices, institutions and policies operating in these fields is essential to effective work in international law firms, multinational corporations and international legal work in government. The first part of this course examines the international trade landscape, the main institutional protagonist, namely the World Trade Organization, and its rules, while the second part examines the legal issues surrounding cross-border investment decisions and disputes, particularly those arising in ICSID arbitrations. The course will equip students with an understanding of the sources of law, its interpretative instruments, the relevant institutions and their rules and the ability to identify common trade and investment issues facing international businesses in order to work out appropriate legal advice and solutions."
LAW423,Maritime and Admiralty Law in International Commerce,"This course aims to give students a foundational knowledge and understanding of the legal principles, commercial context and policies underpinning the law on carriage of goods by sea and Admiralty law practice. It also explains the pivotal role of these areas of practice within modern commercial law, particularly in trade finance, international sale of goods, and maritime arbitration. The course is conducted in a seminar format. The course is taught by specialist maritime and international trade law practitioners, there will be a particular focus on common issues arising in these areas of practice in the context of commercial dispute resolution.

The course will examine the main features and the commercial significance of the different types of charterparties and bills of lading commonly used in international sea trades.  Significant international shipping conventions will be examined from a practical perspective. This course also provides study of the principles and practical application of the law of obtaining security by ship arrest and maritime remedies.  Another main area of study is the role of jurisdiction and arbitration clauses in dispute forum selection."
LAW424,Personal Property,"This elective is designed to complement the Core course on the Law of Property (LAW202).  That course introduced students to basic common law and equitable principles regarding both immoveable and moveable property. Building on the concepts and concerns raised in that Core course, this elective will provide students with the opportunity to consider, at greater depth, the issues and areas of uncertainty that continue to cloud our understanding of how the law of property applies to moveable (i.e. personal) property.  This elective will consider, in particular, some forms of tangible personal property (i.e. chattels), as well as some categories of intangible personal property (i.e. choses in action).  Intangible personal property in the form of intellectual property rights will not be covered in this elective."
LAW425,Advocacy,"The objective of this course is to introduce students to the art of advocacy and court craft, as it is practised in Singapore. It will be practice-oriented and skills-based. The course will consists of 10 weeks of seminars and 6 practice sessions by lawyers, including SCs from 2 leading law firms. They will cover specific areas such as development of case theory, opening statements, cross-examination techniques and closing submissions. This will give the students real insight into the actual workings of litigation practice in Singapore and an opportunity to interact with and be inspired by the very best litigators in town through the practice sessions. The practice sessions will be a series of 4  learn-by-doing  workshops, where the students will be asked to perform various advocacy tasks using a case study in a simulated court room environment. The seminars will focus on the following areas:
  Development of case theory
  Pleadings
  Preparing for trial
  Drafting Opening Statements
  Drafting Affidavits Examination-in-chief
  Learning Cross-examination and Re-examination
  Drafting Closing Submissions
  Ethics and Etiquette
This will give students a hands-on opportunity to practice trial techniques and strategies with the assistance of experienced and skilled trainers, who will offer constructive and practical suggestions in a supportive learning environment. Students will develop essential advocacy skills, including effective preparation and communication skills, and develop their own effective style of advocacy."
LAW426,Law and Policy of Ethnic Relations in Singapore,"Singapore has been touted as a success story in the maintenance of stable ethnic relations in Singapore. Despite its beginnings as an improbable nation, Singapore's economic success has been dependent on political stability, of which the absence of overt ethnic conflict is fundamental. This course seeks to critically examine the legal framework and policies for the management of ethnic relations in Singapore. Laws alone are manifestly inadequate in maintaining peace on hot-button issues of race, language, and religion. The course will also examine the political framework in place that complements the legal and policy infrastructure. At the end of the course, students will be better placed to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of the Singapore approach to the management of ethnic relations. Comparative studies will be done, where applicable, to articulate the key themes and issues."
LAW427,Comparative Law of Sales,"International trade is of growing importance to most economies and is a critical part of the Singapore economy. Trade often involves contracts for the sale of goods and commercial lawyers should be familiar with the law of sales and with how it varies from place to place and from the basic common law of contracts. The course compares and contrasts the UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods, the Singapore law, the Uniform Commercial Code, and the common law in the treatment of sales transactions. There are references to the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Transactions. The course is problem oriented, and the problems are based upon real cases or disputes. Students are expected to participate in classroom discussions of the problems and other materials. Learning outcomes: (i) increased understanding of differing legal regimes and how they may be applied to common problems; (ii) further development of analytic skills and comparative understanding; (iii) increased skills in identifying relevant legal issues within complex fact situations; (iv) development of skills in close statutory analysis."
LAW428,Family Law,"This course covers non-Muslim family law in Singapore. Topics include the formation and termination of marriage, the legal and economic aspects of the husband-wife relationship, the legal and economic aspects of the parent-child relationship, and foreign marriage laws."
LAW429,Corporate Insolvency Law,"Insolvency law is concerned with debtors who are unable to repay their debts. This course will consider the rules and processes which the law has developed to address this ever-present problem, with a focus on debtors which are companies. In particular it will cover, in more depth than in LAW205, the formal processes available in Singapore   receivership, schemes of arrangement, judicial management and liquidation (winding up). In those contexts, the substantive policies and principles of the law will be addressed   e.g. , the pari passu principle, the concept of set-off, and the avoidance of suspect transactions entered in the run-up to insolvency. In addition, the course will consider informal debt restructurings (work-outs), and also introduce the issues and developing law relating to cross-border insolvencies. As well as providing a theoretical grounding in corporate insolvency principles, it is expected that aspects of the course will involve the participation of specialist insolvency lawyers from private practice, with the aim of providing a practical perspective.
Although the primary focus will be on corporate insolvency, comparison will be made with the procedures and rules applicable in the bankruptcy of individuals. It is likely that before or during the period of the course the Government will publish a draft Insolvency Bill combining and amending the rules applicable to both individual and corporate insolvency. If so, the course will take those proposals into account."
LAW430,International Moots 2,"International Moots 2 is the second component in the International Moots program. Whereas students in International Moots were taught the fundamentals in research, writing, and appellate advocacy, students who excel in the selection round for International Moots will be applying the said skills in various international competitions such as the Jessup Moot in Washington DC and the Vis Moot in Vienna. Each moot team will be closely supervised by at least one coach who has the relevant experience and qualifications. Unless there are exceptional circumstances, students must have taken International Moots to be considered for International Moots 2."
LAW431,Law and Development,"There have been dramatic developments in democratic and legal reform in recent years in all  developing  or  emerging  regions of the world, not least in Asia. The spread of general principles of human rights and constitutional, representative government based on the rule of law seems both possible and urgently necessary. This course discusses law reform and rule-of-law implementation in developing countries - the enactment of laws and creation of judicial and other institutions designed to create economic growth and environmental sustainability, improve governance, implement human rights, create access to justice, and resolve political conflicts. But how can and how should developing countries and emerging democracies develop their legal systems, embracing the  good-governance  principles of democratic representation, international human rights, entrenched property rights, transparency and accountability? How can they deal effectively with corruption and abuse of power, and establish political stability and sustainable development?"
LAW432,Foreign Direct Investment Law and Practice,"The proliferation of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and free trade agreements (FTAs) containing investment protection chapters is responsible for the rapidly expanding and changing field of foreign direct investment law. What was once an esoteric part of public international law that dealt with direct expropriation and compensation standards has now developed into a sophisticated body of complex rules that are applied in investor-state disputes by international tribunals. The course will consist of a systematic examination of key principles and policies of foreign direct investment law, a close study of the several obligations undertaken by host state in its treatment of foreign investors, a critical examination of the compensation standards that have been developed by international tribunals, and the settlement of disputes under various investment protection agreements. The materials that will be analyzed in the course will be the BITs and the investment protection chapters in the FTAs concluded by Singapore, a few principal model BITs issued by countries such as the US, some typical foreign investment protection laws of some ASEAN countries and the decisional law of investment dispute tribunals such as the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)."
LAW433,Financial & Securities Regulation,"This course aims to give students a practical overview of the principles and statutory regime relating to the regulation of securities in Singapore. Where relevant, comparisons will be made with other jurisdictions such as the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Hong Kong.  Topics to be covered include the capital markets and the regulatory authorities, the pre-listing and the listing process for securities, continuing listing obligations and delisting from the stock exchange."
LAW434,Global Financial Regulation: Crisis and Coordination,"In 1970, 90% of international transactions were for goods or services.  By the start of the recent financial crisis, by contrast, almost the same percentage was directed to capital movements unrelated to trade.  The regulatory apparatus of international finance, however, still needs to catch up.  To help us appreciate as much, our study of global financial regulation will proceed in three parts:  We will begin, by way of foundation, with a series of sessions directed to several of the key dimensions of international financial regulation today.  Thereafter, we will explore the cause and consequences of the financial crises that have rocked the global economy over the last century   from the Great Depression, to the East Asian financial crisis and the recent financial crisis   and will seek to draw lessons from each.  Finally, we will consider the growing dimensions of cooperation and coordination at work in global financial regulation   from the harmonization of disclosure standards to the rise of transnational networks."
LAW435,Philosophical Foundations of the International Legal Order,"In Article 38(1)(d) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, it is acknowledged that a source of international legal norms which can be employed by judges in the court is the writing of publicists. These publicists   writing on the nature and structure of international law   have an impact in analysing and evaluating international law, as well as an input into the shape and development of international law.

In this course students are invited to engage in the analysis, evaluation and application of a range of key philosophical approaches to the study of international law advanced by these publicists. These theories are empirical, normative or critical in approach, or are a combination of all of these approaches. We will look at these theories and will consider how they might relate to familiar doctrines found in international law."
LAW436,Comparative Law and Economics,"Introduction to Comparative Law and Economics. The application of economics to the study of legal families. The Legal Origins literature: overview, critique, public policy implications, the law and development debate. Lawyers and judges from an economic perspective. Specific topics for comparative law and economics: property, torts, procedure.

This is an advanced course that focuses on comparative legal studies from a law and economics perspective, in particular, discussing the efficiency of legal rules that vary across the world and assessing the implications for economic growth."
LAW437,Law and the Technologies of the Twenty-First Century,"This course focuses on the technologies of the Twenty-First Century - primarily so-called  red  and  green  biotechnologies, information and communication technologies, novel neurotechnologies (such as brain-imaging), and nanotechnologies - considering, on the one hand, the challenge presented by these technologies as regulatory targets and, on the other hand, their potential use as regulatory tools (using CCTV, DNA profiling, etc). Five key regulatory challenges are highlighted, namely: (i) adopting a prudent and suitably precautionary approach to risk; (ii) setting standards that are legitimate (as well as employing legitimate regulatory means); (iii) rendering regulation effective (or fit for purpose); (iv) maintaining a sustainable connection between law and technology; and (v) acting in a way that respects cosmopolitan calls for both compliance with universal standards and tolerance of local cultural diversity. These are the challenges of regulatory prudence, regulatory legitimacy, regulatory effectiveness, regulatory connection, and regulatory cosmopolitanism."
LAW439,Principles of Singapore Income Tax,"This course covers the main or fundamental principles of Singapore income tax, including the tax framework, the distinction between income and capital payments and expenditures, tax residence, the taxation of resident companies, individuals and other resident taxpayers, the taxation of non-residents, the concept of withholding tax, anti-avoidance provisions and capital allowances. Other topics may also be discussed briefly, e.g. double taxation agreements, international taxation and transfer pricing. The aim is to equip students with a basic knowledge of the fundamental principles of income tax so that they can appreciate how income tax works in Singapore and the common issues that may be faced by businesses and other persons in relation to income tax."
LAW440,Entertainment Law,"There really is no subject matter called Entertainment Law.  Unlike Constitutional Law, Securities Law, Bankruptcy Law and Labour Law, which each deal with a defined area of the law, Entertainment Law is a catch-all phrase that encompasses all the various type of legal issues that attorneys have to deal with in the above-mentioned entertainment industries.
This course will examine many of these legal issues, both from a case and transactional viewpoint.  Case law will focus almost exclusively on California and US cases, simply because there are so many more cases decided under these laws, and other jurisdictions tend to look to these decisions when dealing with similar factual and legal issues.  Students who understand the basic legal issues discussed will be able to find the appropriate case law in whatever jurisdiction they are practicing. Issues covered will include: contracts, torts, labour law (mostly collective bargaining agreements), (limited) copyright and trademark issues specific to film/music/publishing, Lanham Act (unregistered trademark law), idea submission cases, and both statutory and common law causes of action particular to these industries, including a brief review of accounting issues in the film industry. 
Mixed into the case studies will be an introduction to a number of common contracts in the film industry writers, directors, actors, producers, distributors etc.---and students will learn the main deal points and many negotiating strategies surrounding these contracts."
LAW441,The Law of Guarantees and Related Securities,"Guarantees (and related securities) are of fundamental importance in commercial financing arrangements. This course examines the relevant law, especially in the context of difficulties faced by those practitioners working in this area. There is analysis of a range of topics including: the execution of the guarantee; circumstances in which the guarantor is discharged; the enforcement of the guarantee; the special problems arising when there is a restructuring of a loan agreement; and the rights of the guarantor both before and after payment. Attention is also given to the use of performance bonds in international business transactions. The course will be especially relevant and useful to those students who wish to practise in the field of commercial financing."
LAW442,Contract Negotiation and Drafting,"This course will examine the lawyer s role in practice in the process of negotiating and drafting contracts. It will start with a re examination of the rules by which Courts decide whether there is a contract, particularly in lengthy and complex negotiations. It will then consider how the Courts decide what the contract means.

The bulk of the course will then consider how the parties can most effectively negotiate towards agreement and how that agreement should be drafted so as to provide the desired results."
LAW443,Law of International Trade,"This course aims to give students an understanding of the legal principles underpinning the law on the international sale of goods, and its crucial role in the international trade and commercial context. It will provide students with an overview of the main features and commercial significance of the different sale contracts commonly used in international trade, and transportation and financing aspects of international trade and dispute resolution procedures commonly used. It also explains the pivotal role of this area of practice within modern commercial law, particularly in trade finance and international sale of goods."
LAW444,Competition Law,"The course will cover the Competition Law of Singapore and the major regulations, guidelines, and decisions published by the Competition Commission of Singapore.  In addition, the course will compare the Singapore Competition Law with the laws in effect in the United Kingdom, the European Union, and the United States.  Coverage of the competition laws of other jurisdictions will not be comprehensive, but the coverage will be enough to provide students with a basic understanding of comparative approaches.  The course will consider the economic rationale for regulation of competition, the definitions of relevant markets, improper horizontal agreements, vertical restraints of trade, mergers, justifications for agreements or consolidations that might otherwise run afoul of the law, and enforcement mechanisms."
LAW445,Principles of the Law of Restitution,"The prevention of unjust enrichment as an independent legal principle, capable of founding causes of action, gained currency as an independent branch of the common law in England and Singapore only as recently as in the 1990s. This course introduces students to the central concepts and disputes in the law of restitution, focussing on unjust enrichment and restitution for wrongs as organising themes."
LAW446,International Law and Global Politics,"This course will introduce international law theory and practices that concern contemporary global issues, which range from the Palestinian Authority s United Nations statehood bid, South China Sea disputes to the economic crisis in Europe.  The course is not only designed for students seeking to acquire basic knowledge necessary to pursue a career related to international relations or transnational business, but also for students who wish to understand the in-depth legal and political analysis of real-world situations.  Each class will begin with an introduction to international law principles, followed by case study discussions. The course will cover legal issues such as custom and treaties under international law, the relation between international and domestic law, the determination of statehood and recognition policy, national governments  jurisdiction and immunity, states  international responsibility, the role of international courts, and the legal structures of international organizations.  Due to the fast-growing development in international issues in Asia, the course will also focus on practices of Singapore, China, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)."
LAW447,International Construction Law,"Construction and infrastructure projects are increasingly international in nature and with such projects are on the rise given their economic benefit, it is crucial for legal practitioners to be aware of the various issues that arise from them.

This course is intended to introduce students to the practice and law relating to international construction and infrastructure projects.  The various methods of procurement and the legal issues concerning the construction process involved will be reviewed in conjunction with the standard forms of contract used for such projects -- such as the FIDIC, JCT and NEC forms, among others.  Issues such as defects, time and cost overruns and the implications therefrom (and how these matters are dealt with in an international context) will also be covered.

The course will provide students with an understanding of how international construction projects are procured, planned and administered as well as give an insight into the legal and commercial issues that arise during the construction process."
LAW448,Joint Venture Law (Singapore - Indonesia),"Firms are increasingly committing themselves to global markets. Many such firms do so by associating in a joint venture which is chosen as a form of doing business for various reasons.  In the age of outsourcing, firms that are rich in intangible assets such as a brand name that has a reputation for quality or superior knowledge may be averse to the risk of dissipation posed by outsourcing. Instead it would choose to engage in a joint venture which can control the knowledge through the joint venture vehicle of which the source firm is a participant.  The surge in collaborative ventures may also be driven by considerations of access to markets, access to capital, seeking benefits from economies of scale, a syndication of risk, or access to local organizational capabilities and positional assets such as distribution outlets.

For Singapore based firms venturing abroad, Indonesia offers many low hanging fruits.  An abundance of natural resources, the largest population and the largest market in ASEAN, and a dynamic economy attract overseas business in ASEAN. Often going it alone in Indonesia is not an option for various reasons.

A student who successfully completes the course would have a clear understanding of the common law on joint ventures, would understand the differences between Indonesian company law and Singapore law insofar as these are material in negotiating and documenting a corporate joint venture, be able to analyze significant clauses in a joint venture agreement, and provide for successful termination and dispute resolution."
LAW449,Legal and Commercial Principles in Project Financing Transactions,"Finding a means of financing major infrastructure projects is a key to the project s ultimate success. Project financing is a favoured means of enabling governments across the world to build roads, ports and airports; provide power to their people; exploit natural resources; build  medical facilities; and finance a myriad of other public works. Looking at the legal perspective, the course will provide an introduction to the way in which major projects are financed, focusing on the key features of the financing and the players who bring infrastructure projects to life.  Attention will be paid to the key legal and other risks which must be addressed through the project financing, and the adaption of project financing techniques to different regions of the world and different types of projects. The course will use practical examples and conclude with involvement of the students in practical exercises in evaluating government concession arrangements and the terms of a project financing."
LAW450,International Arbitration Practice,"International Arbitration has become the default means of resolving disputes between parties from different countries. With increasing globalization, international trade, and international contracting, the number of international arbitration disputes has steadily increased--especially in Singapore, which has become a major arbitration hub. Many Singapore and international law firms have arbitration teams in Singapore many more will form these teams in the near future to take advantage of the steady upward trend in the volume of casework in the region. Arbitration work is by definition international, peripatetic, multi-lingual, multi-cultural and spans all industries that make up international business. No two cases are the same. It is a challenging field that attracts talented lawyers from all over the world. It is an exciting time to be an arbitration lawyer in Singapore.

This course provides a rigorous  hands-on  practical introduction to International Arbitration with a focus on experiential learning. The aim of the course is to prepare the student to practice in the field of international arbitration. The method of instruction is through lectures, workshops, and practical written and oral exercises. The course is a  learn by doing  academy on an arbitration case from start to finish.  We will utilize a case study as the vehicle through which students will be exposed to advising a client on all stages of the dispute resolution process, from selecting the appropriate dispute resolution mechanism and drafting the dispute resolution clause, steps and strategies to take when a dispute arises, to working through all phases of the arbitration process till award, and post-award proceedings in courts."
LAW451,Pre-trial Practice in Civil Litigation,"This course introduces students to pre-trial practice in civil litigation, and serves to blend legal principles of civil procedure with practice. Between the commencement of an action and the actual trial, various pre-trial applications and matters would have to be dealt with. This course, which is practice-oriented and skills-based, will consist of 6 workshops premised on a hypothetical case scenario, and covers specific pre-trial areas including drafting of pleadings, interlocutory applications, affidavits and submissions."
LAW452,Appellate Practice in Civil Litigation,"The objective of this course is to introduce students to the art of appellate advocacy and court craft as is practised in Singapore.  It will be practice-oriented and skills-based.  The course will consist of 4 classroom seminars, and 2-3 practical sessions.  The course will cover the substantive and procedural law specific to appeals (including appeals from the High Court to the Court of Appeal, from the Subordinate Courts to the High Court or within the High Court, i.e. appeal from registrar to judge).  It will also focus on the drafting skills specific to appeals as such the drafting of the appellant s case, respondent s case or further arguments, as well as the techniques relevant to appeals such as oral advocacy.  The practical sessions will involve students being asked to draft appellant s case, respondent s case and to conduct at least 2 appellate moots (both as appellant and respondent) in a stimulated court room environment. 

The course seeks to provide students a hands-on opportunity to practice appellate techniques and strategies with the assistance of experienced and skilled trainees who will offer constructive and practice suggestions in a supportive and learning environment."
LAW453,An Introduction to International Banking and Financial Regulation,"Financialisation has become an important phenomenon in mature and developing economies worldwide, and the globalisation of the financial sector has spurred developments in international banking and financial regulation. The regulation of banks and financial institutions in the intermediation of global money looks set to increase in importance at the national, regional (such as the EU) and international levels. The course aims to provide students with an inter-disciplinary and up-to-date overview of the contemporary developments in financial regulation internationally and in key jurisdictions, such as the US and UK."
LAW454,Law and the Changing Media Environment,"This course will examine how the news media   broadly defined to include newspapers and other serial print publications, radio and television broadcasts, and Internet websites   are regulated by law and government policy in Singapore. To set the scene there will be a consideration of freedom of speech and expression and, in particular, press freedom as a constitutional concept; and how these should be balanced against countervailing public interests such as protection of privacy, reputation, and confidence in the administration of justice. This will be followed by an examination of the following topics: how the print and broadcast media (including the Internet) are regulated; defamation law as it relates to the media, particularly the public figure and responsible journalism defences; criminal offences such as contempt of court, criminal defamation and sedition that restrict the publication of certain types of content; conflict of laws and criminal extraterritoriality issues arising when material from abroad can be accessed in Singapore; and the efficacy of self-regulation in the media industry. A number of these issues will be illuminated by examining key court judgments such as Review Publishing v Lee Hsien Loong [2010] 1 SLR 52, CA, and Shadrake v Attorney-General [2011] 3 SLR 778, CA; and legislation such as the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act (Cap 206, 2002 Rev Ed) and the Broadcasting (Class Licence) (Amendment) Notification 2013 (S 330/2013). In addition, to provide a cross-border perspective on the subject, comparisons will be made between the law in Singapore and a legal regime that is more restrictive (possibly China) and one that is more liberal (probably the United Kingdom), where possible."
LAW455,Law of Cybercrime and Digital Investigations,"The course will encompass, on a comparative law basis, but using as a starting point, English and Singapore criminal law, the relevant substantive law applying to cybercrimes, it will critically assess investigative powers and techniques, criminal rules of evidence, criminal jurisdiction and international co-operation based on the Cybercrime Convention and international enforcement co-operation (eg extradition) and the role and liability of internet intermediaries such as Online Service Providers, payment providers and domain name providers and critically balance state powers, the need for preventing and prosecuting cyber criminality and civil liberties. In terms of substantive law will cover computer and internet misuse (hacking etc), fraud and related offences, content control offences and communication offences. Much emphasis will be placed on the internet as a cross-border medium and the consequent complexity of investigating and prosecuting cybercrime."
LAW456,Domestic and International Sales,"A large portion of the Singapore economy depends upon trade in goods.  Sales and purchases of  things , such as automobiles, furniture, semi-conductor chips, medical devices, pharmaceutical products, petroleum products, agricultural products, and so on are covered by the law of sales.  In Singapore sales law, which is part of contract law, is governed by the Singapore Sale of Goods Act ( SOGA ) which is essentially the same as the UK Sale of Goods Act.  Sales of goods that cross national boundaries are presumed to be covered by the UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods ( CISG ) to which Singapore and almost 80 countries are parties. 

This course will focus on cases and problems arising under SOGA or CISG, or both.  There are interesting differences between the statutory treatment of sales and the basic common law of contracts, and a lawyer who works in the commercial area needs to be aware of those differences.  Lawyers must advise clients about whether to choose to be governed by the CISG or to follow the  opt out  procedures of the CISG and have domestic law apply to a transaction. 

The course also will take note of sales law issues that have arisen in several countries with which Singapore has major trading activities and which could affect Singaporean companies.  Some attention will be paid to the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Transactions, a set of principles that incorporate, in various ways, elements of the lex mercatoria, the customary law of international sales transactions.

The focus will be on practical problems that are common to international sales transactions and students will have the opportunity to work through various problems that are based on real cases."
LAW457,Construction Law,"Singapore is a hive of construction activity   high rise offices, hotels, and residences; highways and the MRT. The work is factually and legally complex and gives rise to many disputes. The course will consider the development of contract and tort law which has been promoted by these disputes, contracts; sub-contracts; sub-sub contracts   the position of architects, engineers and surveyors. The effect of delay and defective work and the impact of changes of plan."
LAW458,Public International Law and Domestic Law: International Commerce,"Public international law is no longer the exclusive domain of the government lawyer. This course addresses the increasing interface between public international law and commercial/corporate private practice which is most manifest in international investment law, international trade law, international commercial arbitration and other discrete aspects of law which relate to international commerce. Bearing this in mind, the course not only provides students with an introduction to key principles of public international law which they may encounter in private practice but also covers practical aspects of international investment law/international arbitration/international trade law to students who intend to practise in these areas. The convergence between public international law and commercial/corporate private practice is also intensifying in other areas of practice such as international financial law, cross-border mergers and acquisitions and international insolvency law. This course will also briefly introduce students to these topics."
LAW459,Drafting in Corporate Practice,"This skills-based, drafting-focused course aims to introduce students to the practical aspects of drafting of corporate transactional documents through a study of common corporate documents across selected areas of corporate practice, namely mergers and acquisitions, banking/financing and joint ventures. Students will learn the fundamentals of the review and drafting of such corporate documents. The course will also give the students an insight into legal risks that clients face and discuss options and strategies to manage such risks through effective drafting."
LAW460,Drafting of Commercial Agreements,"This course will look in detail at the structuring and drafting of commercial agreements and ultimately, the interpretation of various clauses in these commercial agreements. Students will be taken through a variety of commercial agreements including agreements for the sale of goods, distribution agreements, agency agreements, employment/services agreements (such as consultancy agreements), licence/franchising agreements. Further, this course will introduce students to a number of corporate transactions and their relevant documents.

Precedent agreements will be used to illustrate how relevant clauses fit into each agreement as a whole and interrelate with other clauses. In addition, it will look at a selection of case law in order to explain why certain clauses are drafted in a particular way and the problems parties may face if they do not have a full understanding of how a court will interpret such clauses."
LAW461,Principles of Taxation of International Business Transactions,"This course provides an overview of the fundamentals of Singapore income tax, including the taxation of companies and individuals. The course will also cover selected tax incentives, anti-avoidance provisions, withholding tax concepts and double tax treaties. Other topics will also include mergers and acquisitions, international taxation, transfer pricing and indirect tax. Finally, it will look at Asia and provide an overview of some tax systems (i.e. China, Indonesia, and Thailand).

This aims to equip students with the knowledge of the fundamentals of income tax to help them comprehend the income tax system in Singapore and the common issues faced by corporations and other persons related to income tax."
LAW462,Introduction to Civil Procedure,"Students will be acquainted with the more fundamental and practical aspects of civil litigation such as commencement of proceedings, pre-trial applications, appellate procedures and enforcement of judgments both within and outside jurisdiction.  This course will provide students with a good grasp of the underlying principles and policies of civil litigation as enshrined in the Rules of Court and related sources of civil procedure.  Students who enrol in this course will have a good headstart and grounding for Civil Litigation in Part B of the Singapore Bar Exam."
LAW463,Intellectual Assets and the Law in Asian Economies,"The economic significance of Asian economies already speaks for itself. However, attention to its intellectual assets and law is simply lacking. The course sets to promote Asian awareness among Asian economies in the area of IP assets and the law. It aims to make students ask  why Asian IP assets and law? ,  what is special about Asian IP assets and law? . Given the vast geographic coverage and developmental discrepancy in Asia, this course can only strive to look into patent, trademark, and copyright law in China, India, Japan and Taiwan. That said, this course will still dig out intellectual assets and law in other jurisdiction which exhibit features and uniqueness seldom seen elsewhere. In addition, this course will also explore the possibility of .cooperation in patent, trademark, genetic resources and traditional knowledge, especially in the form of Asian Patent Convention, Asian Trademark Office."
LAW464,Legal Issues in E-commerce,"The course deals with the legal aspects of the commercial exploitation of the Internet, in particular, with the use of the Internet as a platform for commerce. It includes a theoretical as well as a technical backgrounder to illustrate the complexity of the environment and to enable the students to understand the architecture of the Internet and to comprehend its implications (and limitations) for business   both with regards to such simple activities as setting up an on-line shop and with regards to the provision of specialized communication or content services. The course aims to prepare students not only to understand the current legal problems and business trends, but also (to the extent possible) to anticipate future developments. By giving a snapshot of the e-commerce market, its major players and dominant business models, the individual topics focus on existing challenges of both legal and technological nature. Students will be guided through the respective legal issues that arise at various stages of establishing an online business or adapting an existing business to the online environment."
LAW465,Law Study Mission (to non-Asian Country),"Businesses do not operate in a vacuum but in a social, economic, and legal context. The legal environment is particularly important given the fact that substantial economic value is captured by contracts as well as a range of intellectual property rights, and credible enforcement of such contractual and property rights have significant impacts on management and entrepreneurship decisions. The aim is to provide a contextual examination and deeper understanding of law-making, judicial institutions, legal practice and law-related bodies in that country and how they relate to the conduct of business. Through the LSM the student is expected to gain an appreciation of the formation, practice and application of law, and the legal institutions and culture in their wider business context within the foreign system. The LSM aims to expose students to these aspects when they visit and engage in participant observation and interviews of firms, legal institutions and businesses overseas as well as stakeholders, including governmental agencies. The purpose of the course includes exposure to the most critical issues of international business and entrepreneurship in the city that is part of the study mission."
LAW466,"Evidence, Litigation and the Criminal Process","Building on LAW103 Criminal Law, this course aims to familiarise students with the entire criminal process and its stakeholders, from the exercise of prosecutorial discretion to the sentencing of an accused person. The subsequent appeal process will also be examined. Where possible, the more important evidential rules that apply to criminal cases will be reviewed. A theoretical and practical approach (incorporating drafting and advocacy exercises) will be adopted throughout the course to ensure that students appreciate the legal principles and how these are applied in practice. In addition, students will be exposed to practical exercises, where they will be asked to prepare submissions on sentence, a mitigation plea, a petition of appeal, or skeletal appellate arguments. On successful completion, students should be able to demonstrate a sound understanding of the criminal process as a whole and how cases progress through the criminal justice system."
LAW467,International Financial Regulation,"Financialisation has become an important phenomenon in mature and developing economies worldwide, and the globalisation of the financial sector has spurred developments in international banking and financial regulation. The regulation of banks and financial institutions in the intermediation of global money looks set to increase in importance at the national, regional (such as the EU) and international levels. The course aims to provide students with an inter-disciplinary and up-to-date overview of the contemporary developments in financial regulation internationally and in key jurisdictions such as the US and UK."
LAW468,Foreign Investment Law in China,"For many lawyers and legal advisers working in Asia, an increasingly important aspect of their work is their more substantial involvement in cross-border transactions with PRC components.  Most of these transactions are large-scale commercial transactions, and this Course will focus on those kinds of transactions.

Even amongst commercial transactions, there are many types and the work that an adviser needs to work on is varied and, in many cases, complex, difficult and growingly challenging (given the differences between two jurisdictions).  This Course focuses on a few of those transactions such as joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions, banking finance: it is not possible in the time available to deal with all of them.

The approach in this Course is to follow a fairly straightforward transaction for a single client through from beginning to end.  It will start with the client, who has never done business in the Mainland China before, coming to the legal adviser seeking legal advice and assistance.  Then the client will decide on the type of business it wants to use, taking into account the many factors the client needs to consider.  The client will then set up the business in the Mainland China.  After that it will buy some materials and sell some products.  It will also need to raise some money for the business. Later on, it may expand its China business by merging or acquiring a target company (or its assets). Unfortunately, a dispute will arise and the client will seek advice on how to deal with it.

The aim of this Course is to enable you to be acquainted with the legal issues in regard to foreign investment projects in China and associated commercial legal transactions. This Course will appeal not only to LLB/JD students but also future entrepreneurs seeking to do business in China."
LAW471,Capital Markets Law in Asia,"This course explores how the financial and securities markets are structured and regulated in Asia, particularly in Mainland China and Hong Kong. The topics covered in this course include, amongst others, the regulatory framework for the securities markets, the disclosure philosophy of securities regulation, fundraising regulation, stock exchange listing, prospectus liability, anti-fraud rules on the trading of securities, takeovers, and enforcement strategies in the securities regulation. Given the nature of the course, a comparative approach will be adopted to examining the topics covered. The course is essential for students intending to do business in the Asian financial and securities markets."
LAW474,International Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Practice,"Commercial transactions now frequently take place across borders. The growth of international trade has given rise to a corresponding increase in the number of transnational commercial disputes. Commercial parties desire a swift, practical and cost-effective resolution of such disputes. National legal systems were designed primarily to manage intra-jurisdictional disputes and were perhaps not particularly well-equipped to deal with cross-border disputes.

International arbitration has provided a big part of the answer and serves as a primary if not default means of resolving transnational commercial disputes today. More recently, the courts in a number of jurisdictions have also innovated to fit into the changed dispute resolution landscape. They have established specialized international commercial courts such as in Dubai, and most recently, in Singapore as viable alternatives to international arbitration, depending on the parties  particular needs.

Any student with interest in pursuing a career in international commercial dispute resolution needs to have a good grasp of the process of the creation of commercial law and how they are enforced through various dispute resolution mechanisms.  The objectives of the course are to equip students with a working knowledge of the Singapore International Commercial Court, as well as prepare students to practise in the field of international arbitration. Course content is roughly divided equally between international commercial dispute resolution and international arbitration.

The part of the course on international arbitration will be focused on practical aspects of international arbitration procedure. It will be a  learn by doing  academy which may revolve around a case study as the vehicle through which students will be exposed to some of the more significant stages of the dispute resolution process.

Some knowledge of the basics of international commercial arbitration and commercial conflict of laws would be complementary though not necessary."
LAW475,Transnational Business & Human Rights,"Over the last twenty years, scholars and practitioners have shined a spotlight on human rights conditions in transnational industries including oil and mining; manufacturing; agriculture; pharmaceuticals; and internet/telecommunications. Courts have increasingly had to contend with these cross-border issues. As the activities of corporations often transcend national frontiers and the consequences of such activities can be felt in a great number of States, there is increasing awareness that some form of supranational regulation of corporations is necessary in certain areas such as the protection of human rights and the environment and the fight against corruption.

During the same period, business and human rights has emerged as a distinct field. The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (2011), for example, define a corporate responsibility to respect human rights. In response to growing pressure to address human rights issues, some transnational companies have begun to conduct human rights due diligence and integrate human rights considerations in corporate policies and practices.

Drawing on international standards, industry case studies, legal proceedings, the work of international organizations, and a growing academic literature, course explores the theoretical difficulties in securing corporate responsibility for human rights abuses within the framework of transnational law; as well as the practical aspects of enforcing such responsibility in international and national courts and tribunals, with a particular focus on the Southeast Asian region."
LAW476,Medical Law and Health Policy,"Faced with an aging population in Singapore, healthcare is taking centrestage.  Coupled with better education and exposure, our people expect to receive nothing less than a high quality of care.  Not surprisingly, litigation in this area has been on the rise.  An awareness of the issues in health law will therefore equip lawyers to deal with this growing trend.  Areas to be covered in this course include access to healthcare, physician-patient relationship, informed consent, medical negligence, medical malpractice, regulation of TCM, Mental Capacity Act, advanced medical directive and health insurance.  Students will be fascinated to discover that Health Law incredibly straddles across numerous traditional branches of law such as torts, contract, insurance law, criminal law and administrative law."
LAW477,Law and Psychology,"A fundamental function of the law is to regulate different facets of human behaviour.  However, the process of regulation must start off with an understanding of what is to be regulated. It is therefore not surprising that psychology   the study of human behaviour   provides a wealth of insights to the legal fraternity, be it practitioners, judges, enforcement agencies and policy makers.

This course provides, for law students, an introductory glimpse into the intersection between law and psychology. We will adopt a topical approach, where students explore different areas of the law and psychology s relevance to them each week. A sampling of the issues we will cover include:

   mental disorders and their implications for offending behaviour and criminal procedure
   human memory and its effects on eyewitness and courtroom testimony;
   custody evaluations and psychological assessment in family law proceedings;
   behaviourial theories underlying principles in tort and evidence law; and
   how lawyering skills such as negotiation, persuasion and advocacy can be enhanced and informed by psychological research.

This course seeks to develop better practitioners for the future by giving fledgling lawyers the psychological lens they may require to make sense of practical issues that commonly arise in practice. Students will also grow to appreciate that the law does not operate in a silo, but in the context of other disciplines that contribute towards its practice, policy, institutions and mechanics."
LAW478,Professional Mediation Skills,"This course explores the various theories and practices of mediation. The stages of the mediation process and techniques for each stage are taught. Simulated role-play exercises are arranged to develop skills as mediators.

This course aims to provide students with a strong grounding in problem-solving mediation, and the opportunity to develop practical skills as a facilitative mediator. After successfully completing this course students will be able to:

1) Explain facilitative mediation and the purpose of each stage in the process;
2) Explain the different approaches to mediation and when each might be appropriate;
3) Apply the skills and techniques in communication, negotiation and mediation.
4) Reflect meaningfully on the practical experience and analyze how the experience relates to conflict resolution theories.
5) Research and critically discuss some current issues in conflict resolution and effectively present (orally and in writing) your research findings."
LAW480,Foundations of ASEAN Law and Policy,"This course is intended to provide students with a foundation in the core legal features of ASEAN, while simultaneously cultivating their appreciation of the various factors   (geo)political, economic   that shape the process and direction of its further development. To that end, the ASEAN experience will be examined by combining a macro- and micro-perspective. The course will invite students to evaluate the path that ASEAN has followed so far and contrast this with the choices that have been made in other regions; inquire into ASEAN s relationship with non-member states and other international organizations; and critically reflect on how future challenges ought to be tackled. At the same time, considerable attention will be devoted to the actual rules and policies geared towards delivering ASEAN s objectives   with those pertaining to the ASEAN Economic Community taking centre stage in this regard   and the institutions and processes that make possible the adoption and execution of these substantive norms.

This course aims to equip students with foundational knowledge about ASEAN rules, policies and procedures so that they can confidently tackle the ASEAN-dimension of cross-border questions awaiting them in their legal careers   be it in legal practice, as in-house counsel or working for the Singapore government."
LAW482,Deal-making and Dispute Resolution: Negotiation in an Age of Disruption,"Whether you are an entrepreneur, a business consultant, a lawyer or a salsa dancer, you will find yourself negotiating every day over every conceivable thing. Sometimes you will negotiate in a professional capacity on behalf of a client or your organisation; other times you will negotiate in your capacity as a private person. Your negotiations may be transactional in nature or they may be focused on resolving a problem or a dispute.

In this age of disruption, negotiation skills are essential for dealing with the unprecedented challenges of complex and evolving global and local landscapes.

This course offers a robust evidence-based framework to teach you the  next  practice strategies and skills required for negotiating transactions and managing conflict effectively in dynamic, complex, multi-cultural, and international settings. In this course, you will:
 acquire and enhance  strategies and skills for effective negotiation in a variety of deal-making and dispute resolution settings.
 understand yourself as a negotiator working in a diverse spectrum of cultural, legal, professional and/or leadership contexts. 
 increase your capacity to recognise, understand and incorporate changing trends in cross-cultural negotiation and dispute resolution.
 understand the role of professional negotiators in dispute resolution settings such as mediation.
 develop negotiation strategies and skills to represent yourself or your client in a mediation or similar dispute resolution setting."
LAW483,Law & Regulation,"This course examines the objectives, structure and instruments of regulation. The legal framework and significance of regulation as well as the economic underpinnings of regulation and deregulation will be considered. The course introduces the student to theoretical and practical issues involved in the regulation of business and other activities."
LAW484,Economic Analysis of Law,"This course examines the role of economic principles in analyzing the law. It seeks to provide students with an understanding of the law based on microeconomic analysis. Under the economic approach to law, laws are viewed as providing incentives for changing human behavior and as instruments for achieving policy objectives. This course also explores the implications of economic principles for what the law should be. The economic approach to law places emphasis on the criterion of efficiency, particularly in analysing private law (property, contract and tort law). The course also addresses criticisms of the economic approach to law, in particular, the redistributive approach to private law."
LAW487,Topics in Financial Crime,"As Singapore s reputation as an international financial hub grows, the risk and occurrence of financial crime also increases. This course is designed to give students an understanding of the key concepts and issues in three areas of the law relating to financial crime, namely: (1) the market misconduct provisions in Part XII of the Securities and Futures Act that deal with inter alia the prohibition against insider trading and the market disclosure requirements; (2) the law on corruption; and (3) the law relating to anti-money laundering.

The course is taught by practitioners in the Attorney-General s Chambers who will examine the theory and practice in these three areas of law, including how such cases are investigated and brought before the Courts. Students will be expected to critically examine the regulatory environment; the law and the policy operating behind the law; and the role of the different stakeholders in addressing criminal offences committed in the financial sector. Students will hopefully appreciate the balance required in upholding the rule of law while maintaining Singapore s reputation as a business-friendly, yet well regulated, international financial centre."
LAW488,International Humanitarian Law,"This course will provide a firm foundation on one of the oldest parts of public international law the so-called  laws of war  but now known as  international humanitarian law.  Our first classes together will try to distinguish how and why this law is different from  human rights  (a much later development (i.e. post-World War II) for the discipline), which will require consideration of some of the earliest iterations of the laws of war such as the principle of distinction and the principle of unnecessary suffering. Students will then be introduced to some of the major legal questions of our time, for example the treatment of Taliban and Al Qaeda members at Guantanamo Bay and the entitlement to prisoner-of-war status by members of Islamic State (Da esh). We shall also explore how public international law deals with the issue of nuclear weapons, taking the atomic attacks of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 as our lead examples, as well as the choice of targets (i.e. the increased destruction of hospitals in the Syrian conflict, as shown in The New Barbarianism). There shall be a strong reliance on actual examples of warfare from Vietnam, to the destruction of cultural property such as the Buddas of Bamiyan of Afghanistan, through the justice for  comfort women  or sexual slaves who suffered at the hands of Japan at the end of the Second World War to the belligerent occupation of Iraq to explain the basic tenets of and strengths of the law but also the unique problems by trying to introduce order into chaos."
LAW490,International and Comparative Insolvency Law,"This course seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of insolvency law from a comparative approach, with a particular focus on the law of the United States, the United Kingdom and various jurisdictions in Continental Europe, Asia and Latin America. It will be shown that, even though most insolvency jurisdictions seek to solve similar economic problems, the way to do so differs across jurisdictions. After becoming familiar with the insolvency regime existing in some relevant jurisdictions, we will analyse which factors and insolvency provisions may help create an optimal insolvency regime. In order to do so, we will take into account the economic problems that insolvency law seeks to solve, the particular features of a country, and the impact that the solutions provided by insolvency legislators may have on entrepreneurship, innovation, and access to finance. It will be shown that insolvency law is a very powerful tool to promote growth in a country. For this reason, linked to the fact that many jurisdictions want to become global centres for corporate restructurings, several countries around the globe are amending their insolvency laws. Among other proposals, we will analyse those existing in the United States and Europe, and which steps are being taken by Singapore to become a global leader for corporate reorganizations. The course will conclude with an analysis of the primary problems, challenges and solutions to deal with cross-border insolvency. For that purpose, we will analyse the features of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency, as well as some regional initiatives - such as the European Insolvency Regulation- to deal with those problems arising in a situation of insolvency in which there is an international component."
LAW492,Dispute Resolution: The Role of Experts,"The commercial world is full of agreements, some of which will inevitably fall into dispute.  Those disputes can be resolved through many mechanisms from negotiation through to the more contentious litigation.  As commerce has become more complex so have the disputes.  This has given rise to the increasing need for expert witnesses or advisors across fields such as finance & accounting, construction, shipping, law, IT and the sciences (microbiology, geology, chemistry, engineering etc.).

This course looks at the role of experts in the dispute resolution process.  The course draws its examples from the two most commonly used expert types, being Finance/Accounting and Construction experts.  The course culminates in a mock trial where participants will have the opportunity to cross examine experts.  This course is ideal for lawyers interested in a career in dispute resolution and non-lawyers considering careers as expert witnesses in their chosen profession, particularly Chartered Accountants and Chartered Surveyors."
LAW494,Comparative Corporate Governance,"The business corporation is a central pillar in modern societies. Despite the fact that most countries around the world provide a form of business corporation, there are considerable differences in the way corporations are owned, governed, and controlled. This course seeks to explore how companies are managed and controlled around the world, and what problems may arise from the interaction of shareholders, managers, creditors, employees, and other stakeholders. It will start by analysing the role and function of corporate governance, and why it matters for firms  access to finance and the promotion of economic growth. It will then analyse the different agency problems and corporate ownership structures existing around the world. The course will cover a variety of topics in corporate governance, including board composition, directors  duties and liability, executive compensation, and the balance of power between managers, shareholders and other stakeholders. It will then analyse how to protect outside investors from the opportunism of managers and controlling shareholders. The course will also analyse the rationale and regulation of hostile takeovers from a comparative perspective, with particular emphasis on the law of the United States, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, China, Japan, Singapore, and Latin America. The final part of the course will be focused on the analysis of new issues and discussions existing in corporate governance, including shareholder activism, short-termism, dual-class shares, and the concentration of share ownership in the hands of institutional investors. It will then conclude with an analysis of the corporate governance challenges generated by new forms of financing such as crowdfunding and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)."
LAW495,Compliance and Risk Management for Lawyers,"This course examines the rules and standards that govern the subject of compliance and risk management. It will start by examining questions of governance: boards of directors, executives and third party vendors. We then examine the compliance function, organised by the nature of the enforcer: managers, regulators, prosecutors, whistleblowers, and gatekeepers. Next we turn to particular areas of the law: data protection, Prevention of Corruption Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and UK Bribery Act, money laundering and terror financing, and sexual harassment in the workplace. We examine cases where compliance fails (e.g., Enron) and initiatives that go beyond compliance (e.g., codes of ethics, social responsibility standards, and institutional culture). The last part of the course will consider risk management as it pertains to lawyers; topics here include the governance of risk; approaches to risk management; reputational, operational, and enterprise risk; and case studies of instances where risk management failed."
LAW496,Launching an Online Financial Business - the Lawyers Role,"In a reflection of today s client needs, in this SMU-X course, students will be advising a brick-and-mortar financial company on its conversion to an online company. The students will cover the client s journey from beginning to end   understanding the client and its needs, conducting research and analysis on applicable laws, presenting their findings to the client, and making recommendations on the way forward.

Students will be guided by both SMU instructors and practitioners from Linklaters. The SMU instructors will give the students a basic grounding in the applicable principles of contract law, financial regulations, and data protection concerns, and advise students as they conduct independent research on the problem. Linklaters attorneys will provide their perspective as practitioners, including the practicalities of any solutions that the students propose. The Linklaters attorneys will also discuss their own experiences of guiding clients on such projects.

Through this course, students will learn to apply theoretical principles to real-world situations. They will also benefit in learning from legal practitioners who have extensive experience of such situations.

By the end of the class, students should be able to: (i) understand a client s needs on a particular project, (ii) conduct independent research and analysis on the client s project, (iii) present their findings to the client in a coherent and easily understandable manner; and (iv) make suitable recommendations for the client."
LAW497,Chinese Commercial Arbitration,"The Chinese arbitration practice began from the 1950th, when CIETAC and CMAC were established to resolve international commercial disputes at vacancy of arbitration laws. The aim of this course is to help students understand systematically the progress of Chinese Arbitration Laws, find out the way to resolve commercial disputes, either domestic or international through arbitration according to the current Chinese arbitration laws. The main contents of this course include: A general introduction to arbitration; Determination of the validity of arbitration agreement under Chinese Arbitration Law; Arbitral tribunal and its jurisdiction; main procedural issues under Chinese Arbitration law; Judicial review of the People  Court to arbitral award; Recognition and enforcement of different kinds of arbitral awards in China. From the above, some interesting and special issues will be addressed e.g. whether foreign arbitration institution is allowed to conduct arbitration seated in China? And whether awards made outside China without foreign elements can be recognized and enforced according to the 1958 New York Convention."
LAW498,State Courts Clerkship Programme,"1. The State Courts   NUS & SMU Clerkship Programme ( the Clerkship Programme ) is a judicial clinical programme designed to provide top law students with the opportunity to be attached to senior District Court Judges ( Supervising Judges ) and acquire experiential knowledge of law practice through direct exposure to judicial work. It is a unique course which allows law students to acquire a different perspective of legal work through personalised interaction with senior Judges, working on actual cases and experiencing legal practice in real-life settings.

2. In the course of the Clerkship Programme, the Clerks will be required to assist Judges with legal research and case analysis in cases involving more complex legal issues. The Clerks will experience the realities of court proceedings from observing court hearings and interacting with the Judges. From the vantage point of the decision-maker, the Clerks will get to experience first-hand the adjudication process of receiving and weighing relevant facts and evidence, assessing the credibility of witnesses, and persuasion by opposing parties.

3. The Clerkship Programme will allow Clerks to practise and consolidate legal skills already acquired under the core curriculum through case research, writing and analysis. Through exposure to court litigation, the Clerks will be able to hone higher cognitive legal skills through critical analysis of facts, evidence, legal arguments and persuasion, as well as to gain a unique understanding of the critical processes in fact-finding and decision-making from a judicial perspective. Through interaction with Judges and other legal professionals, such as lawyers and court staff, the Clerk will learn higher level professional skills in communication and court craft, which are critical in their future careers as lawyers. The clerkship training will allow Clerks to learn the intricacies of various processes and rules in the context of judicial administration and engage in self-learning of substantive areas of law across disciplines.

4. As the Clerkship Programme is intended to prepare the Clerks for life as a legal professional and takes place in a real world setting where court schedules are subject to change and other exigencies, the learning experience can be expected to be a rich and varied one. As Supervising Judges are engaged in their own professional work, the range of support that the Clerks can provide can vary depending on the types of cases that come before the Judges.

5. All Clerks must be prepared to take ownership of their own learning and time management by capitalising on opportunities for learning, discussion and reflection. Clerks are required to find opportunities to complete the list of minimum tasks listed in paragraph 14 of this syllabus, and are encouraged to add to the list as the opportunity arises."
LAW499,Legal Commentaries for Practice (Advanced Legal Writing),"This SMU-X course aims to give SMU law students opportunities to publish legal commentaries on topical issues, hone their writing and editing skills, and learn more about the legal start-up industry. This course is a collaboration with Asia Law Network (ALN), a law tech startup which also provides practitioners a platform for publishing articles on topical legal issues <http://learn.asialawnetwork.com>.

As a refresher on the fundamentals of legal analysis and writing, students will start with writing a case commentary on a topical CA judgment. They will then write two short legal commentaries, which will require both research and analysis. The commentaries will involve topics of practical significance, analysis of which would be helpful to practitioners and/or the general public. These topics will include (but are not limited to) those identified by ALN.

As part of the learning process, students will work in pairs: they will review and edit each other s work (including reviewing the research and analysis conducted by their partner), and in doing so hone their own analytical and writing skills. Students will also focus on communicating their analysis in a manner which is helpful to both lawyers and non-lawyers.

Students will receive close guidance and supervision from the instructor, including frequent feedback and in-person consultations. They will also receive practical feedback from ALN on their commentaries, including the usefulness of their research and analysis.

Students will also be able to gain insights into the legal tech industry, through discussions with ALN personnel.

At the end of the course, students will have the opportunity to submit their papers to SMU Lexicon <https://smulexicon.com> and ALN (articles may be cross-posted on both sites). This will allow their writing to reach a wider audience. This will also help students develop their body of work as they move from school into practice."
LAW610,Law of Mergers and Acquisitions,"This course is designed to provide an overview of the regulation and practice of mergers and acquisitions transactions in Singapore. Where relevant, comparisons with other jurisdictions such as United States (particularly Delaware), United Kingdom, Australia and Hong Kong will be made. The topics that would be covered include mechanics of structuring mergers and acquisitions transactions, the preparatory work that is required in connection therewith, the regulatory environment in which mergers and acquisitions take place, duties of participants engaged in mergers and acquisitions (including legal advisers, financial advisers and directors of acquirers and target companies), deal protections, deal tactics for friendly and hostile bids, disclosure obligations, compulsory acquisitions and financing.

Case studies, adapted from real life examples, will be used extensively in the course.


A review of the takeover regulation models of the United States of America and the United Kingdom   the two leading takeover regulation models in the world will be made and the impact on the Singapore regulatory scheme will be discussed.  References will also be made to the regulations in Australia and Hong Kong.

The focus will be on familarising participants:

(i) on the multi-faceted regulatory scheme governing mergers and acquisitions in Singapore;

(ii) with the preliminary consideration to be taken into account before launching and structuring a takeover bid;

(iii) with the anti-competition legislation in Singapore and its impact on mergers and acquisitions;

(iv) on the conduct of the takeover bid, disclosure requirements and dealing restrictions;

(v) on the duties of the directors and all other key participants;

(vi) on the documentation involved in the takeover process;

(vii) on the procedures involved in friendly and a hostile bids; and

(viii) on the compulsory acquisition process under the Companies Act.

Case studies, adapted from real life examples, will be used extensively in the course"
LAW627,Intellectual Property Law and Policy: International and Asian Perspectives,"It is fair to say that few branches of the law have, in recent times, developed as swiftly and explosively across jurisdictions as the law of intellectual property (IP). In Singapore, this is evidenced by the Government s push for a sound and comprehensive legal framework for the promotion and protection of IP, and by the setting up of the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) and the IP Academy. More recently, several amendments were made to Singapore s IP legislation in order to implement the country s obligations under the United States   Singapore Free Trade Agreement.

You will, in this course, be introduced to the different types of IP rights and the various branches of IP law, in particular the law of copyright, patents and trademarks. Apart from learning the fundamental principles of IP law and the impact of international IP conventions and treaties, we will have the opportunity to explore, from a comparative perspective, the various policy issues which underpin much of the IP debate   in particular, controversies surrounding the protection, exploitation and enforcement of IP rights. Through group project work and presentations, we shall also examine how the IP regime operates in appropriate Asian jurisdictions and assess whether the protection and enforcement mechanisms in these jurisdictions measure up to international norms and standards.

The study of IP was, until quite recently, a somewhat esoteric specialisation. Today, IP occupies a central position in the global, knowledge-based economy and this course should therefore appeal to those who wish to equip themselves with knowledge of a burgeoning and highly relevant area of the law."
LAW630,Directed Research,"To apply to do a Directed Research (DR) paper, participants must have passed the first term of LLM studies with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.3.  Applications to do a second DR will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  The participant must have already successfully completed the first DR and must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.3 at the time of application for the second DR.

As the DR paper is taken in lieu of a taught elective course, it must reflect sufficient rigor in terms of research, original content and contribution to existing literature. A DR paper is to be completed within 3 months from the date of approval. A  DR paper is expected to contain 12,000-15,000 words."
LAW631,Foreign Investment Law in Asia,"As the pace of globalization increases, so do the number and types of transactions across national borders.  One such transaction is foreign investment which is important to both capital exporting countries as well as to host countries.  The subject of the course concerns the legal obligations of the host state to honor its commitments to foreign investors.  Such obligations could derive from customary international law as well as treaty law.  Arguments asserting that investors owe obligations, by virtue of their status as investors, to the host country will also be examined.

A knowledge of foreign investment law is obviously important to advisors of both the foreign investor and the host government.

When persons invest in foreign countries, they have to consider not only commercial risks but also political risks.  The level of political risk may be so high that a potential investor may be deterred from investing.  The law of foreign investment is concerned primarily with the legal protection that is provided to foreign investors.  A knowledge of foreign investment law is an important, and sometimes indispensable, for various stakeholders in the foreign investment community.  For the primary actors - the investor, the host government, and a local joint venture partner - a clear understanding of these principles allows these participants to intelligently craft a foreign investment plan. Entities whose support of  the proposed foreign investment venture, such as banks, suppliers, and customers, would also need to be assured that the political risk has been reduced by situating the proposed venture in the framework of applicable foreign investment law."
LAW632,"Financial Regulation in Singapore, Hong Kong and Greater China","This course will explore various topics relating to financial regulations in Singapore and Greater China, including Hong Kong, Mainland China and Taiwan, We will focus mainly on banking regulations; but some issues in insurance regulations and capital market regulations will also be compared and considered. As the economy grows amid potential further financial integration in Southeast Asia, it is important to have an overview of financial regulations in major financial centres in Southeast and Northeast Asia. Throughout the courses, we will discuss and consider a wide ranges of issues from licensing, prudential regulations and conduct of business rules to OTC derivatives regulation and resolution of systemically important financial institutions as well as anti-money laundering and terrorism financing. We will discuss both theoretical issues as well as some details of regulations to allow students to have a bird eye view of key issues facing financial regulators and market participants in the post-Lehman era."
LAW633,Beyond the Law: Regulatory Mechanisms in Cross-border Issues in the Asian Context,"Law is the leading but certainly not the only regulatory mechanism in the political, social and economic realms.

Indeed, a simplistic over-reliance on the law and the legal system in the conduct of business, social and economic matters is inadequate in protecting one s rights, interests and needs especially when the rule of law is weak.

Other regulatory mechanisms that can aid in governance in the public and private realms include ethical value systems, soft law, conventions and norms, as well as networks in the various facets of human endeavours. Together with  hard law , they provide a variegated and nuanced way to protect and enhance rights, interests, and norms.

This module seeks to develop an appreciation and understanding of these quasi-legal regulatory mechanisms, and how they can be used in conjunction with hard law and the legal system to protect one s rights and interests, with particular reference to Asia. How can such regulatory mechanisms advance accountability, regulate affairs in the different spheres of human endeavours?

Issues that are examined include ethical challenges, management of corruption, ethnic business networks, corporate governance concerns that are prominent features in the Asian business landscape.

This module is structured on an eclectic set of readings drawn from different disciplines, broadly comparative in nature, and inter-disciplinary at heart."
LAW634,International Business Law: An Asian Perspective,"The development of international business serves as a vital factor in the expansion of multinational enterprises and national economic growth. This is particularly important for Singapore and other Asian countries that have adopted an export-oriented policy and promote the export of goods and services in international markets. It is thus critical for lawyers and business leaders to understand the legal aspects of domestic and international transactions, as well as global trade regimes. To this end, the course will provide an overview of legal issues that apply to the sale of goods transactions, the meanings and applications of trade terms such as CIF and FOB, and methods of financing sales. In addition, the course will discuss the resolution of commercial disputes and regulatory issues involving trade barriers to foreign direct investments and WTO/FTA rules. It is expected that students will examine international business cases and problems from an Asian perspective, gain presentation and advice-giving experience and, learn to utilize legal concepts to improve the decision-making process to manage transnational business."
LAW635,Trusts and Wealth Management in Singapore and Hong Kong,"This course is a study of the use of the trust in wealth transmission with an emphasis on Singapore and Hong Kong law.  In the world of wealth planning private trusts are used to manage family wealth and therefore it is important to have a good understanding of the doctrines underpinning the trust. By the end of the course, you should understand: (a) the main issues in wealth transmission; (b) how the trust is used to manage family wealth and the various functions the trust performs, such as the avoidance of probate or for asset protection purposes; (c) a solid grasp of the issues that arise in respect of controlling trustees  discretions, trustee liability, the rights of the objects of trusts, and the questions surrounding purpose trusts; and (d) an overview of the issues confronting wealth advisors such as dealing with vulnerable clients etc.   While the law in Singapore and Hong Kong is very similar to the law in England, there are subtle differences in terms of legislative provisions which will be highlighted.  Otherwise, the main principles would be similar to English law.  This course aims to provide students with the legal knowledge to identify critical issues should they wish to embark on a career in trust and wealth services."
LAW636,Chinese Contract and Business Law,"Contract law is of primary importance to business and commercial activities.  It is one of the most established areas in China's civil and commercial law system.  The course will provide students with a comparative perspective on selected issues in Chinese contract law and other related areas of business law.  At the same time, it will introduce the main features of Chinese legal system and its practice of private law by incorporating the insights from recent studies on Chinese economy, politics and society.  This course also serves as a gateway to understanding of other fields of Chinese business and commercial law.  It will cover, among others, contract formation, contract policing, performance and non performance, interpretation of contracts, contractual remedies, and rights of third parties."
LAW638,Directed Research,"The DR provides an opportunity for you to undertake in-depth research on a legal topic of your choice. It contributes to the development of a wide range of transferable skills such as writing skills, research and methodological skills, analytical skills, independent thinking and project management skills (action planning, time management, monitoring and evaluation). The capacity to produce a clearly structured and well written piece of work can be highly rewarding from an academic and personal perspective.

As the DR is undertaken in lieu of 2 taught elective courses, it must reflect sufficient rigour in terms of research, original content and contribution to existing literature. The word count for the dissertation is 15,000-18,000 words."
LAW641,Asian and Global Trends in Information Technology Law,"Participants will be taken through the many legal issues and problems that arise from and relate to developments in Information and Communications Technology. The course will build problem-solving skills in dealing with a subject matter that is still evolving in the context of a rapidly evolving technology and innovation environment, and that is impacting socio-economic transactions and stakeholders on a global scale. Participants will be taken through the policy considerations and general Singapore legislations and judicial decisions on the subject with references to foreign legislation where relevant and useful.

New legislative developments will also be considered in detail. In particular, more recent amendments to the Electronic Transactions Act of 2010 relating to e-contracts, e-signature and intermediary liability; the enactment of the Personal Data Protection Act in 2012 relating to data protection, the do-not-call registry and the Spam Control Act; changes to content regulations, specifically the class licensing regulations in 2013; the new Protection from Harassment Act and recent amendments to the Copyright Act in 2014 and 2016. The latest trends and developments in other jurisdictions relating to every topic will also be considered."
LAW643,Cross-Border Mediation: Professional Skills and Practice,"This course deals with the rapidly growing area of private international mediation.  Imagine the following scenario: You are asked to mediate a professional negligence dispute.  The plaintiff is based in England, the defendant accounting firm is in Hong Kong, and the defendant s insurer has its headquarters in the United States.  All agree to attend mediation in Singapore. The preliminary discussions and meetings, however, take place via email and video-conference with all parties in their home countries.  The mediation occurs and the parties reach a settlement, which the parties  legal representatives draft into contractual form. Such cross-border mediations involve:
  international and intercultural competencies;
  online and face-to-face mediation processes and protocols; and
  knowledge of the applicable law in relation to the substantive and procedural aspects of mediation.

This course offers you a framework for understanding cross-border mediation law and practice and the opportunity to develop specialised mediation skills relevant to cross-border settings. Simulated role-play exercises are arranged to develop your skills as a mediator.

Upon successful completion of the course and related assessment, participants will be able to apply to the Singapore International Mediation Institute (SIMI) for mediator accreditation. Participants who wish to do so may inform SIDRA staff at learning@sidra.academy. SIDRA will verify the results of the assessment and refer the participant s application to SIMI. For more information about the SIMI credentialing scheme, see: http://www.simi.org.sg/What-We-Offer/Mediators/SIMI-Credentialing-Scheme. In addition, participants who complete the course and the related assessment may apply for Australian accreditation through the University of Western Australia. For more information about the application procedure through UWA, please visit: www.mediation.uwa.edu.au ."
LAW644,Law and Technology,"Law and Technology as a title corresponds to a broad category which instructors may narrow down to the following specialized areas of instruction for a particular academic year.

International Commercialization of Intellectual Property Rights
Under this specialization, the course provides an introduction to the legal and practical issues that arise when attempting to commercialize intellectual property rights (IPRs) such as patents, copyrights and trademarks.  Case studies of how IP rights affect methods of commercializing software and IP issues arising on the Internet will also be considered.  The impact of antitrust laws and the role of an effective IP enforcement strategy will be examined.  The course will then turn to look at different ways of dealing with IPRs: assignment or sale, licensing, and joint ventures; and the different challenges they present.  The role of IP in the financing of businesses will also be considered. 

Intellectual Property Law and Policy: International and Asian Perspectives
Apart from learning the fundamental principles of IP law and the impact of international IP conventions and treaties, this specialization will provide the opportunity to explore, from a comparative perspective, the various policy issues which underpin much of the IP debate   in particular, controversies surrounding the protection, exploitation and enforcement of IP rights.  Through group project work and presentations, the course will also examine how the IP regime operates in appropriate Asian jurisdictions and assess whether the protection and enforcement mechanisms in these jurisdictions measure up to international norms and standards.

Asian and Global Trends in Information Technology Law
Participants will be taken through the many legal issues and problems that arise from and relate to developments in Information and Communications Technology. The course will build problem-solving skills in dealing with a subject matter that is still evolving in the context of a rapidly evolving technology and innovation environment, and that is impacting socio-economic transactions and stakeholders on a global scale. Participants will be taken through the policy considerations and general Singapore legislations and judicial decisions on the subject with references to foreign legislation where relevant and useful. New legislative developments, relating to e-contracts, e-signature, data protection, content regulation and intermediary liability, will be considered in detail. The latest trends and developments in other jurisdictions relating to these topics will also be considered."
LAW645,Advanced Law of Obligations: A Study in Commercial Remedies,"The law of obligations is an important aspect of commercial law, and through this course, we will study the interaction across the law of contract, the law of torts, equity, and restitution. We will do this through the lens of commercial remedies principally. In this regard, commercial remedies constitute the end product of any legal dispute but is mired in great uncertainty and potential confusion. We will consider the subjects in the law of obligations that commercial remedies transcends, through a structured and comprehensive discussion of all aspects of Singapore commercial remedies, ranging from issues in contract, tort, equity and restitution. We will discuss key cases that have hitherto never been discussed in a commercial remedies context and draw the threads together on a practically relevant and commercially important area. We will also focus on relevant decisions from other Commonwealth jurisdictions, which contributes to the comparative jurisprudence and enhances its relevance to the broader, global audience. Given its comprehensive treatment of Singapore commercial remedies as well as its reference to a wide range of comparative material with a view towards an advanced understanding of the law of obligations, this course will be highly relevant not only to local practitioners and students, but also to students from other common law jurisdictions"
LAW646,Judgecraft,This course (consisting of compulsory and elective modules) focuses on judgecraft and bench skills that are essential to judicial decision-making. The modules of this course are drawn from the core programmes that are offered by the Singapore Judicial College.
LAW647,Judicial Dissertation,"The Judicial Dissertation is a compulsory core module for the LLM in Judicial Studies. As the dissertation is undertaken in lieu of 1 taught course unit, it must reflect sufficient rigour in terms of research, original content and contribution to existing literature. The dissertation for the Master of Laws (Judicial Studies) must involve empirical judicial research. For guidance as to what empirical judicial research entails, students may refer to the empirical judicial research projects administered by the Singapore Judicial College.

Internship is done during the school term, and may involve nominal payment from the company. Students will receive a pass/fail grade after their internships."
LAW651,Law of Real Estate Securitisation,"While space and the built environment is ubiquitous, real estate remains a unique asset class. The rules relating to its current and future value, how it may be securely transferred from one party to another and its very definition all depend on law. Property development, investment and securitisation are all aspects that real estate market players take cognisance of. This course provides a legal primer on the legal fundamentals of real estate practice, with an emphasis on the regulations pertaining to securitisation of real estate via a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) or Business Trust (BT).  Where relevant, comparisons with other jurisdictions will be made. The course is both practical and academically rigorous and is relevant to students with an interest in real estate transactions and securitisation."
LAW652,Business Law,"This course is designed to help students acquaint themselves with the framework of Singapore s legal system and to understand the legal environment within which businesses operate. A substantial part of the course is dedicated to the study of contract law principles, as the making and performance of contracts which form the rudiment of all businesses. Students will also be introduced to the law of torts and will, in particular, learn the essentials of the tort of negligence."
LAW653,"AI, Law and Ethics","The course embarks on an investigation into some prevalent ethical and legal challenges that arise out of the application of contemporary technologies in society.

Earlier classes provide a brief introduction to the concept of AI and ethics. The real and hypothesized risks of AI are considered, alongside AI s capabilities and applications across different sectors and industries. This is followed by an examination into the definition of ethics, current ethical codes and frameworks, and the role of ethics as providing a self-regulatory frame for the creation of fair, explainable, transparent, non-discriminatory AI systems.

The course then moves into an exploration of both mainstream and alternative approaches to AI ethics. Students are guided to explore ethical theories such as utilitarianism, non-consequentialism, and virtue ethics. Underrepresented perspectives on AI ethics such as vulnerability theory, posthumanism, postcolonialism theory and eco-justice are also examined. These discussions enable students to consider the theories they find most relevant and fitting for AI ethics and for managing AI systems. Additionally, by engaging and critically evaluating with these perspectives, students are encouraged to cultivate a deeper appreciation of the barriers associated with translating these ethical principles into practice.

Moving on, the course is interested in the operation of AI and technology in the legal sphere. The impact, opportunities, and challenges associated with the deployment of AI in the legal sphere are traced, followed by an investigation into the emerging legal issues associated with AI applications. Questions of interest here include the responsibility and liability of AI systems, the impact of AI on individual rights and liberties, the emergence of AI-enabled crime, AI s interference with an accused s due process rights, and the influence of AI on Democracy and the Rule of Law. In subsequent classes, real-life case studies are cited to present the ethical issues and challenges associated with the application of AI in practice. The case studies explore themes associated with the erosion of privacy and surveillance, the determination of justice and fairness, the threat to human dignity, issues of misinformation and (dis)trust, responsible innovation, and the power and accountability of State and big tech companies.

The above determined issues are all examined in light of current legal regimes managing contemporary AI systems. Students are asked to assess the adequacy of current legal frameworks alongside limitations of AI ethical frameworks. They are led to recognise how the pace in which AI is advancing and transforming the world means that existing laws are quickly becoming outdated. The limitations associated with AI ethical frameworks would also quickly become apparent prompting the question of what next and where do we go from here?

These regulatory gaps challenge the safe use of technology opening pathways for the abuse and exploitation of new technologies. Increasing calls have been made seeking innovative regulatory models that go beyond self-regulatory or voluntary AI ethics governance frames. Yet, on the other hand, concerns surrounding how over-regulation will stifle innovation continue to emerge. In our final classes, we look at various AI governance approaches   in Asia and beyond   and explore current regulatory initiatives, as well as, more innovative regulatory frames."
LAW654,Trade Regulation in a Global Age,"As business firms expand across the globe, trade regulations also move beyond national borders. The most comprehensive rules on international trade are contained in the Agreements of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which now cover issues including trade in both industrial and agricultural products, trade in services, labor mobility, investment, free trade agreements, health and food safety, and a wide variety of domestic regulatory regimes. Thus, it is important that lawyers advising business firms understand these rules so they may help the clients to structure their transactions to maximize their benefits and minimize the costs.

Taught by a former staff member of the WTO Secretariat who is among a handful of people in the world who have worked on WTO cases as an insider at both the panel and Appellate Body levels, the course will help the students to study the legal rules of the WTO and free trade agreements, which cover tariff measures, antidumping and safeguard measures, food safety regulations, as well as domestic regulations of key WTO Members like the US & China.

Using real WTO cases decided by the WTO tribunals as examples, the students will be able to critically examine how these rules are made, what are the impacts on business firms, how to argue the best case for their clients, and how these rules could be improved in the future.

The knowledge and skills learnt in this course will be helpful for students to participate in various WTO moot courts around the world, and explore a wide range of career options, including private law firms, government agencies (MFA, MTI), multinational companies, and international organizations (WTO, World Bank)."
LAW655,Fintech Regulation,"This course provides an overview of the foundations, evolution and regulatory challenges of financial technologies ( FinTech ) and how the rise of blockchain, Artificial Intelligence and other emerging technologies are reshaping the financial services industry. For that purpose, it starts by analysing different regulatory strategies to promote financial innovation and how countries are competing to become a FinTech Hub. The course will then examine the regulatory developments that try to mitigate the risks of the cryptoassets industry for the financial system and for investors and consumers, as well as the remaining gaps in the regulatory discussion worldwide. The future of money and payment systems is an additional component of this course that will analyse the different regulatory strategies to modernise the digital payments ecosystem by promoting innovation, more competition and regulating the entrance of payment services providers outside the traditional payment methods offered in the banking sector. Additionally, the course will explain how Fintech is driving individuals  and firms  access to finance by providing new fundraising methods such as crowdfunding and Initial Coin Offerings. Likewise, it will also analyse the use and regulatory challenges of Artificial Intelligence in the financial sector. The course will conclude by analysing the financial services industry s present and future in a data-driven world"
LAW656,Essential Technology for Lawyers,"This course employs a top-down approach to introduce high-level concepts in digital technology to lawyers or future lawyers who expect to work closely on legal/policy matters that intersect with technology, and professionals working in the legal sector who intend to leverage on the power of modern computing technologies in both legal research and the delivery of legal services."
LAW657,Compliance And Risk Management For Lawyers,"This course examines the rules and standards that govern the subject of compliance and risk management. It will start by examining questions of governance: boards of directors, executives and third party vendors. We then examine the compliance function, organised by the nature of the enforcer: managers, regulators, prosecutors, whistleblowers, and gatekeepers. Next, we turn to particular areas of the law: corruption (e.g. Prevention of Corruption Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and UK Bribery Act), anti-money laundering, and export controls. We examine cases where compliance fails (e.g., Siemens AG, Boeing 737 Max, Odebrecht) and initiatives that go beyond compliance (e.g., codes of ethics, social responsibility standards, and institutional culture). The last part of the course will consider risk management as it pertains to lawyers; topics here include the governance of risk; approaches to risk management; reputational, operational, and enterprise risk; and case studies of instances where risk management failed."
LAW658,"Venture Capital Fund Strategy, Formation & Negotiations","Technology is eating the world. Venture capital has funded startups to overtake incumbents and grow to over ten trillion dollars of stock market capitalisation over the past twenty years. Trillions of dollars more of value will be disrupted and created in our coming future.

The course introduces you to venture capital from its early days in Silicon Valley to its worldwide spread. The course analyses fund objectives and dives into the economics between venture capital general partners, limited partners, and founders. Students will learn the strategies and competitive differentiation of venture capital funds, as well as the fundamental transactions that lie at the heart of venture capital. The corresponding formation, negotiations, and exit process for venture capital investments will be discussed. This course also speaks on the broader social and economic impact of venture capital and technology in society and its relationships with regulators over the long term."
LAW659,Data Governance: Challenges and Opportunities in a Global Context,"In a globalised world where data and information are becoming increasingly valuable and vulnerable, effective data governance is crucial for individuals, organisations, and societies. Data governance incorporates the collection of processes, policies, roles, metrics, and standards that guarantee the efficient and effective utilisation of data. This course will examine key issues and concepts in data governance from an international and comparative perspectives, employing regulatory and global governance theories to analyse how political, economic, and social forces influence data governance policies in various countries and regions. As data governance assumes a greater role in cross-border economic activities, it is essential to investigate its multifaceted effects and how it relates to various issues notably, national security, human rights, social (in)justice, and geopolitical dynamics. Through interactive discussions, debates, and case studies, this seminar aims to help students gain an understanding of the unique challenges faced by policymakers, businesses, and individuals in the digital era."
LAW700,Law in a Commercial Context,"This is a course to provide law students with the essential knowledge of economics, business and finance. In this course, students will learn the basic economic theories of private and commercial law, basic theories of corporate governance, corporate finance, as well as the structure and functioning of the financial market. In short, this course introduces to students the economic substance underlying commercial and financial laws."
LAW4001,Shareholder Deals and Litigation,"This course is designed to introduce students to practical perspectives on advising corporate shareholders in respect of issues that arise from the management of a company, particularly in the context of joint ventures, and shareholder disputes that may arise therefrom. Students will be guided through the life cycle of a joint venture   from inception to termination, with an emphasis on practical demands of commercial clients and business strategies and inspired by real-life examples of actual cases.

The course will be taught through a mixture of lectures and hands-on workshops, focused on the practical aspects of advice which arise in practice, with feedback by practitioners on the advice/solutions proposed by students. Guest speakers will also share their experiences in handling the practical challenges.

Students will learn to apply theoretical legal principles to real-life cases to meet client needs, ranging from drafting of initial agreements, managing fall-outs, and eventual exits."
LAW4002,Legal Analytics and Artificial Intelligence in Law,"Against the context of Industrial Revolution 4.0, the legal industry is being disrupted by big data analytics and artificial intelligence ( AI ). Legal analytics and AI-driven applications in the law are transforming the nature of legal service delivery across the US, Europe, Australia and now in Singapore. New forms of analytics and AI-driven legal services have emerged in emerging areas such as litigation analytics, automated legal due diligence and the rise of the so-called AI lawyers such as Ross. This course will provide the foundation in the area of big data analytics and AI and explain how the technology works in the legal industry. Students will learn the process of managing the design and development of analytics and AI-driven applications and services to deliver new forms of legal services as legal profession move up the value chain. The course is not designed to teach law students to become programmers or coders."
LAW4003,International and Comparative Secured Transactions Law,"It will provide a comparative analysis of the law of secured transactions in common and civil law jurisdictions with international instruments aiming to modernise secured transactions laws. The module will be divided into three parts. The first part will be introduction. The second part will focus on the principles of the law of secured credit and title financing under common law (English law, UCC Article 9 and PPSAs) and civil law. The third part will focus on the reform of secured transactions law around the world, particularly, in light of the principles of the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Secured Transactions Law and the UNCITRAL Model Law on Secured Transactions. Comparisons will also be made with the EBRD Model Law on Secured Transactions, OAS Inter-American Model Law on Secured Transactions and the World Bank Toolkit on Secured Transactions Systems and Collateral Registries."
LAW4005,Comparative Criminal Law,"This course introduces students to the application of the theory and methodology of comparative law to substantive criminal law. It builds on a student s prior knowledge of a basic course in criminal law by comparing selected principles of the law primarily with those found in Australia, Canada, England, India, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore. Topics covered include the fault elements of murder and negligent manslaughter; consent in rape; the fault element for joint criminal enterprise; principles of causation; the defences of private defence, mental impairment and provocation; criminalising euthanasia; and the German and Dutch laws of homicide and attendant defences. The insights gained by students from comparative analyses of these topics will sharpen their appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of the criminal law of particular jurisdictions, and enhance their ability to view law from wider theoretical, sociological and reform perspectives."
LAW4006,Legal Innovation and Technology,"Innovation and Information technology is fundamentally transforming the nature and practice of law. Buyers of legal services are becoming savvier about the time and cost efficiencies that technology can deliver.  As a result, clients expect their legal services providers to engage technology in their practices and are auditing legal providers  IT systems and capabilities.  This course will explore how technology is currently used in legal practice and how its evolution will continue to shape the legal profession. Students will be asked to grapple with the challenges and opportunities currently facing the legal system, the legal profession and society as a whole (and how technology might be able to help)."
LAW4007,Advanced Law of Obligations,"Many prominent jurists assert a very close connection between the law of contract and the law of torts.  Some   most prominently Peter Birks   have even suggested that breaches of contract and torts comprise a single, unified legal category (wrongs). Although good reasons for this view can be identified, it is observably true that many important disjunctions between these two branches of the law also exist.

The goal of this course is to provide an appreciation of commonalities, connections and divergencies between contract and tort law. The course aims ultimately are threefold. To provide a suitably informed platform from which we may critique:
(i) the common claim that tort and contract together comprise a single legal category:  civil wrongs ;
(ii) certain commonplace theoretical claims about private law (such as some jurists  insistence that there be privity between the parties, and that remedies be underscored by a commitment to corrective justice);
(iii) the difference between the way in which contract and tort accommodate certain pervasive defences in the law (such as duress and limitations of actions)."
LAW4008,International Investment Law,"At the end of this unit of study, students will be able to:
1. understand the principles of international investment law;
2. recall and recount the origins and evolution of those principles;

4. critically analyse the legal concepts and principles studied in arbitral awards; 
5. critically analyse the issues surrounding the structure and procedural aspects of international investment dispute resolution; 
6. identify and apply legal principles in hypothetical fact situations; 
7. demonstrate an ability to think critically, justify ideas in a reasoned manner, and evaluate legal theories relevant to international investment law."
LAW4010,Legal Design,"Legal Design refers to the human centric redesign of legal services, processes and operations that helps legal organisations change and innovate, especially in the context of increasing technology adoption. This course introduces Design Thinking as a specific methodology applied to the context and needs of participants in the legal system today. This course is divided into different sections:  (1) Technology adoption and innovation in the legal industry today; (2) Design Thinking as a model for consensus building and multi-disciplinary project management; (3) Design Methodology (e.g. ethonography studies, user testing frameworks etc.); and
(4) Legal industry context from the perspective of the emerging intersection between business, technology and legal needs.  Learning will be experential in nature through class discussion, activities and a team project."
LAW4012,Entrepreneurship in Singapore - From Cradle To Grave,"This course seeks to provide an overview of what an ambitious Singapore entrepreneur may face in his/her journey to grow a business in Singapore.  Partners@WongPartnership will guide the students through each stage of the entrepreneur s journey and discuss the legal issues the entrepreneur will encounter at the different stages of building the business.   The journey begins when the entrepreneur first look at the options that are available to start a business in Singapore.  While most entrepreneurs will opt for a private limited company as the start-up vehicle, there may well be other options that better suit the business needs.  Most start-ups will then explore ways of raising funds to support the business growth, looking first to venture capital providers and then bank borrowings, before eventually raising monies on the capital markets through an IPO with a listing on the Singapore Exchange.  Life as a listed company on the SGX will be more exciting, as the entrepreneur learns to cope with stricter corporate governance standards.  Pursuing M&A opportunities as a listed company is no longer a decision that entrepreneur can make on his own accord.  A successful listed company will in turn become the target of interest by other companies or private equity buy-out funds, looking to acquire and/or take the listed company private.  Unfortunately, leveraged buy outs don t always end on a happy note; we will explore at the end of the course the scenario where the company struggles with debt servicing and going through the ensuing debt restructuring to save the business.  Some companies emerge from a debt structuring in a good shape.  Some don t."
LAW4013,Commercial Remedies in Litigation,"Remedies are what a commercial litigation client ultimately asks for. This course will guide students in practical aspects of remedies by reference to actual litigation cases. 

Students will study and compare the different remedies used in different cases and learn to assess why they were selected.  When is a freezing Mareva Injunction available as a pre-emptive strike?  Why would a Plaintiff claim Wrotham Park damages instead of normal damages?   What if a defendant is insolvent?  These are some of the questions which a litigant may ask counsel, and which students will explore.

Through case studies, students will assume the role of counsel to understand the tactical advantages and strategic considerations that counsel face   including evidential issues, assessment of damages, burden of proof, selection of defendants and impact of the defendants  insolvency. 

Effective remedies are the bedrock of any litigation practice. Students will gain practical knowledge for a head start in a litigation career."
LAW4014,Dealmaking In Practice,"This course intends to give you a glimpse of what happens in a corporate transaction.

LAW4015,FinTech Law,"This course provides an overview of the foundations, evolution and regulatory challenges of financial technologies ( FinTech ) and how the rise of blockchain, Artificial Intelligence and other emerging technologies are reshaping the financial services industry. For that purpose, it starts by analysing different regulatory strategies to promote financial innovation and how countries are competing to become a FinTech Hub. The course will then examine the future of money and payment systems, with a particular emphasis on the role played by cryptocurrencies and the increasing participation of tech companies, including Facebook, Google and Apple, in the payment services industry. Additionally, the course will explain how Fintech is driving individuals  and firms  access to finance by providing new fundraising methods such as crowdfunding and Initial Coin Offerings. Likewise, it will also analyse the use and regulatory challenges of Artificial Intelligence in the financial sector. The course will conclude by analysing the financial services industry s present and future in a data-driven world."
LAW4016,Legal Issues in US-China Economic Relations,"One of the defining events of our age is the great power struggle between the US and China. This is manifested in every aspect of their relationship, with trade and investment as two primary areas. In this course taught by two leading experts in international economic law, one from the US and one from China, we will conduct an in-depth examination of the many interesting legal issues in the US-China economic relations.

The first part of the course will be lectures with two main modules, with one focus on international trade law and the other on international investment law. Each module will provide a critical analysis of the main issues at stake, the dynamics of the conflicts and negotiations, and how the future will unfold.

After the lectures, the students will form groups to work on pre-assigned topics. Each group will include both SMU and UCI students. During the group work, the students are expected to engage in comparative discussions and reflections.

In addition to learning the substantive legal issues involved in the course, the students are expected to gain the following skills/benefits through this course:
The ability to understand, appreciate and identify with different perspectives and cultures, as well as more awareness on the roles and responsibilities of a global citizen;
The necessary skillsets to work in a cross-cultural environment, especially the ability to go beyond one s comfort zone and quickly adapt to different settings;
New perspectives on international economic issues, and better awareness of the interconnectedness of world communities;
Make new friends in another country, and expand one s social and professional networks."
LAW4017,Using Dystopian Films To Regulate Against A Dystopian Future,"Dystopian fiction serves as both a warning of things to come, as well as a useful tool in planning for such eventualities. This forecasting is valuable in plotting the ethical, social, and legal ramifications of said eventualities and determining optimal regulatory oversight.

More so than other types of stories, dystopian film and television provide highly visual and memorable touchstones for society to discuss complex technological ideas. Consider the recently popular television anthology series Black Mirror, which first aired in 2011.  Many of the show s most disturbing episodes feature seemingly futuristic technologies such as devices that wire directly into the human brain and present the potential consequences thereof. Surprisingly, such revolutionary technologies are not so far off.   A great example of this convergence is Elon Musk s Neuralink Corp. which recently announced a similar device to the one in Black Mirror, the  pending ability of Neuralink s implanted brain chip to allow people to  listen to music directly from our chips [ or] control hormone levels and use them to our advantage. 

Given the warp speed at which fiction and non-fiction appear to be colliding, there are clear teaching opportunities in employing dystopian film and television programs in the areas of pedagogy focused on the intersection between law and technology.  

This course will look to Hollywood s view of dystopia as a jumping off point to analyze the intersection between law and emerging technologies.   The course will focus mostly on the Black Mirror series, but will also look to other shows and film as well."
LAW4018,Dispute Resolution Advocacy,"The proliferation of cross-border business activity has generated an increased demand for international commercial dispute resolution. As alternatives to litigation, arbitration and mediation have emerged as viable routes to the timely and cost-effective settlement of disputes, particularly in Singapore. This course will provide an overview of the role of the dispute resolution advocate within these processes, the legal framework governing their procedure and enforcement, and practical issues of cost and speed across different mechanisms. Participants will be divided into groups and presented with a simulated case to outline the role of an advocate at each stage of a dispute. Written submissions, oral presentations and groupwork will give participants a sound understanding of how an effective advocate must adopt a tailored approach to different processes of dispute resolution."
LAW4019,Computational Thinking and Legal Technology,"This course provides an overview of the technologies and skills that might help students better navigate our increasingly software-eaten world. The course starts by introducing students to concepts in technology and computer science, the history and current state of affairs of LegalTech, and their applications in and to law. In understanding the technologies that shape our world and at the same time, what computers are good (and bad) at doing, the course aims to equip students with the cognitive skills and foundations to thrive in a technology-assisted world.

Whilst giving students a background in technologies and technical concepts, the course methods will be practice-oriented and skills-based: students will work through contract drafting, review, and legal design exercises that will (hopefully) be upskilled by their understanding of computational thinking. 

Students will not be taught how to code and will not be expected to learn how to code."
LAW4020,The Singapore International Arbitration Centre and Institutional Arbitration,"Arbitral institutions are important stakeholders in the field of international arbitration, but the nature and importance of their role have often been overlooked. The course seeks to introduce participants to the role and function of arbitral institutions in the practice of international arbitration, and to the complex issues that arbitral institutions face in the administration of arbitrations, including, amongst others, appointment of arbitrators, issuance of arbitral rules and practice notes, and in guiding and shaping the development of international arbitration. The course will feature guest lecturers from the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) Board of Directors, Court of Arbitration and Secretariat."
LAW4021,International Investment Law and the Belt-and-Road Initiative,"International investment is widely recognised as a powerful catalyst of global economic growth. Therefore, great efforts have been made, by means of investment treaties and domestic regulations, to secure the administration and protection of international investment. Among these efforts, the dispute resolution mechanism is an essential one. The goal of this course to provide an overview of laws regulating international investment, and to examine the available dispute resolution mechanisms and their possible reforms. In this course, students will examine China s Belt-and-Road Initiative (BRI), from China s perspective and in the global context, with particular focus on the settlement of disputes in BRI projects. At the completion of this course, students should be able to appreciate that international investment law is in a process of evolution. Students are expected to gain a systematic understanding of the substantive legal issues and some basic understanding of how they are relevant in the work of international law firms, multinational corporations, international organisations, etc."
LAW4022,Digital Innovation for Access to Justice,"In this course, students will be introduced to topics on  equal access to justice  and how digital technology can assist to bridge the gap for those who lack access to the resources that could help meet their legal needs. Students will work in groups for one or more legal aid organisations or public agencies in Singapore to design and develop a solution that will improve access to justice or the effectiveness of legal representation. Depending on the type of application chosen for the project work, students will learn one or more of the following areas: (a) document assembly and expert systems; (b) chatbots; (c) machine learning and natural language processing; (d) data analysis and visualisation; (e) cloud computing services; (f) search and information retrieval. At the end of the term, the groups will showcase their solutions and compete for the opportunity to represent SMU at the Iron Tech Lawyer Invitational international competition  (https://www.georgetowntech.org/irontechlawyer)."
LAW4023,The Settlement of Inter-State Disputes,"This subject aims to provide an introduction to and an in-depth analysis of international dispute resolution.  The focus of the unit of study is on inter-State disputes and the resolution of such disputes in accordance with public international law.  The subject will review various types of international dispute resolution mechanisms, with an emphasis on the peaceful means of settling disputes.  The whole range of international dispute resolution techniques will be covered, including negotiation, good offices, mediation, conciliation, as well as arbitration and adjudication, involving institutions such as the Permanent Court of Arbitration and the International Court of Justice.  A number of other bodies in the landscape of international adjudication will be considered, including the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the World Trade Organisation, human rights bodies, and arbitral tribunals constituted to settle investment and trade disputes.  Problems arising from the proliferation of international courts and tribunals, and international dispute resolution mechanisms more generally, will also be discussed.  The subject will also consider a number of prominent and topical case studies."
LAW4024,Corporate and Securities Laws in China and US: A Comparison,"Corporations are the most important form of business organizations in the modern world, and securities are critical instruments of corporate finance. In this course, we will have a closer look at the corporate and securities laws in China and the U.S. from a comparative perspective. These two jurisdictions are chosen first for their economic prominence. Knowledge about the key areas of commercial laws in the two largest economies in the world will get students better prepared for cross-border transaction practices. At the same time, these two jurisdictions are also chosen for their distinctive characters in their legal and regulatory frameworks. The corporate and securities laws in China reflect a mixture of its civil law tradition, British law influence through Hong Kong, and American law impact as a result of the bulk of Chinese scholars and regulators studying in the U.S..  On the other hand, despite its common law heritage, the U.S. corporate and securities laws have developed along a unique track due to competition among states and unparalleled depth of its capital market. The topics to be discussed are chosen mainly from the Chinese perspective, with their functional equivalents in the U.S. law are compared. The purpose of the course is threefold.  First, we will learn the basic rules of corporate and securities laws in China and the U.S.. Second, we will understand the social and economic rationales underlying the different rules and practices in these two jurisdictions. Finally, using law as a gateway, we will explore some important business and financial activities in the world s two largest economies."
LAW4026,Critical Topics in Chinese Commercial Law,"This course aims to introduce students to the six critical commercial law topics in China. All the topics are closely relevant to both legal reform and practice in the commercial law arena. The course first discusses the idiosyncratic Chinese rule of law view and explains it from a broader law and development perspective. Then, the course analyzes the business forms available for investors to choose from and their trade-offs. The dual class share structure is introduced as a new form recently available for the investors considering floating the business in the securities market in the future. The Chinese banking system and its risk and secured transactions involve in receiving institutional finance are also discussed in the course. Two highly practice-oriented topics, takeover rules and insider trading regulations, are introduced at the end of the course."
LAW4027,Sustainability Law and Policy,"In recent years, sustainability has become a popular buzzword in society. The need for sustainable development is quickly emerging as an area of focus among businesses, organisations, governments and the media. This course will explore the fascinating intersections between the practice of sustainability and various streams of law and policy. Students will gain exposure to a range of current developments involving sustainability in the real world locally and globally, while reflecting on current laws and policies that address them."
LAW4028,Advanced Topics in the Belt and Road Initiative Dispute Resolution,"With the growth of trade and investment activities, there will inevitably be an increase in the number of cross-border commercial disputes among the BRI countries. The course aims to introduce to legal issues concerning different methods of resolving disputes in international commercial practice. It requires students to consider and reflect upon topics relating to arbitration, litigation and mediation in BRI context. Students will appreciate the convergences and divergences between the BRI dispute resolution mechanisms and international standard practice of commercial dispute resolution from functional and contextual awareness perspectives. The course is divided into two segments, namely, one is on the updates on the international commercial dispute resolution initiatives taken by PRC and the other China and International Legal Order. The course provides information on the functioning of BRI-related commercial litigation, arbitration and mediation and China s position in ISDS reform and its state capitalism."
LAW4029,Sentencing Advocacy,"Do offenders who receive a fine instead of an imprisonment term  get off  lightly? When would an NS defaulter be punished more severely than a domestic abuser? This course will introduce students to sentencing principles and help them understand its highly fact-sensitive nature. As a practice-focused course that focuses on applying the law rather than just learning what it is, students will have the opportunity to learn from actual criminal practitioners and to put theory into practice. Students will primarily be assessed on their written and oral advocacy skills in arguing on sentence as the Prosecution or Defence. The course will culminate in a moot court meant to simulate a plead-guilty hearing in the State Courts of Singapore.

As the vast majority of criminal cases in Singapore are disposed of by pleas of guilt rather than trial, this course will provide a good primer for those interested in criminal practice whether as prosecutors or defence counsel."
LAW4030,Carriage of Goods by Sea and International Trade,"This course aims to give students an understanding of the legal principles underpinning the law on carriage of goods by sea and international sale of goods, and their crucial roles in the international trade and commercial context. It will provide students with an overview of the main features and commercial significance of the different types of charterparties, bills of lading and sale contracts commonly used in international trade. It also explains the pivotal role of these areas of practice within modern commercial law, particularly in trade finance and international sale of goods."
LAW4031,"Regulation: Theory, Law and Policy","Regulation is a permanent fixture in the way the state governs industry and activity, with few areas of activity that are not subject to some form of regulatory control.   It involves the use of a range of legal and non-legal techniques to manage the risks created by industry and activity within the state.  Regulatory policy and practice have evolved and complexified over time: moving away from the traditional method of  command and control  to include more negotiated and cooperative modes of balancing public and private interests in regulatory regimes. This course will provide students with the opportunity to understand and critically evaluate the tools, techniques and decision-making methodologies that are employed in regulatory design and practice.   Students will also consider whether there is too much, too little or the wrong type of regulation in different policy areas. The course will also provide an opportunity for students to understand the limits of formal law when it comes to regulation by examining the subject from different disciplinary perspectives, including law, economics, politics and sociology.  The course will equip students with the concepts and analytical tools needed to evaluate how existing areas of industry and activity are evaluated and also propose how to evolve and enhance regulatory governance to deal with new areas of activity."
LAW4032,Law and Technology,"Law and technology are strange bedfellows. In some sense, the law may be seen as crucial piece of social technology that makes civilization itself possible. Without law, said Thomas Hobbes, life would be nasty, brutish, and short. The Hobbesian reference to automata has also been identified as one of earliest conceptions of artificial intelligence. Thus began a long entanglement between law and computing technologies. The first people to  Code  were lawyers, not programmers. Leibniz, famous for inventing calculus, held a doctorate in law. So too did Schumpeter, the  father  of innovation theory.

But lawyers today are not known for technological competence. Google  why are lawyers bad at  and autocomplete suggests  math .  US lawmakers hauled Facebook before them only to explain how the internet works.  And the US Supreme Court, suggests Nate Silver, is  allergic  to statistics.  These are the people responsible for writing, interpreting, and in some sense enforcing the laws that govern technology.

This course aim to plug the puzzling chasm between lawyers and technologists by introducing tomorrow s lawyers to what technology is and how it is regulated by, and itself regulates, law. We will cover four key themes in particular:

1. The History of Law and Technology
2. Regulating The New Web
3. Artificial Intelligence and Law
4. Legal Technology

Individual readings will be assigned each week.  The overarching goal is to initiate students to the growing world of law and technology and equip them with the basic skills and vocabulary for more focused electives and self-study."
LAW4033,Advanced Topics in Law and Technology,"The goal of the course is to provide a broad appreciation for the intersection of diverse emerging technologies and the law.  No matter what area of law you practice, your clients will likely be employing emerging technologies.  This class is designed to give you a taste of those technologies and the applicable law, so that you are better prepared to service your clients. This course aims to show where the law regulates emerging technology, and where it fails. The course also aims to have an international bent, looking at how different regimes apply their laws, and how those efforts promote or stymie innovation."
LAW4034,Climate Change Law and Policy,"Climate change will be a foremost theme that will influence financial activities, and policy and legal framework for years to come. In a noticeably short time span, climate change has become a global challenge calling for collective action. Climate change law is emerging as a new legal discipline. Students in this course will explore how climate change law relates to other areas of law and how climate change has elicited rulemaking process at the international, regional, national and local levels. The class will be invited to study the negotiation process, implementation and current status of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement. The class will then proceed to evaluate the various legal tools that are available at national and international level to address climate change, including cap-and-trade, carbon taxation, command-and-control regulation, litigation, and voluntary actions."
LAW4035,"Consumer Law, Digital Market and New Technologies","Consumer law is becoming an increasingly important area of law. The market, technology and society are constantly evolving. Therefore, the existent consumer law needs to adapt to new products, new markets, new technologies and the outcome of a rapidly globalised World. In order to conceptually capture these phenomena traditional legal techniques deployed by consumer law, need to be applied in innovative ways and often new legal mechanisms that better fit a new economic reality have to be developed. For example, the rising relevance of online market in the Covid-19 era represents a particular regulatory challenge for consumer law. Compliance with the new consumer law rules is becoming an increasingly difficult task for the businesses. This course will allow students to obtain in-depth knowledge and expertise in key areas of consumer law, whilst at the same time honing their analytical and problem-solving skills. Based on the most advanced legal thinking and taking a global, comparative and interdisciplinary perspective, students will be equipped with the critical understanding and analytical tools necessary for applying new legal concepts and practicing law in the highly complex, sophisticated and dynamic environment of current commercial reality. This is essential for anyone who wants to fully understand the intricacies of consumer law and learn how to fully apply with consumer law requirements."
LAW4036,Global Constitutionalism in a Comparative Perspective,"This course seeks to give students an introduction to comparative constitutional law. It starts with an introduction to the methods of comparative constitutional law, discussing the predominant functional method as well as more recent quantitative-empirical approaches. In a second step, we will analyze whether it is possible to identify families of constitutional legal systems. In particular, we will discuss whether the distinction between common law and civil law that is prominent in comparative private law also has value for constitutional law. The third class will deal with judicial review of legislation. We will start from the fundamental legitimacy problem that the judiciary faces when reviewing acts of the legislature and examine the different responses that constitutions have found to address this problem. The fourth part addresses the structure of government. We will not only analyze different ways how governments are accountable to their citizens, but also look at empirical evidence on the economic effects of governance design choices. The fifth part deals with fundamental rights and addresses in particular the structure of the fundamental rights analyses. In many jurisdictions, the proportionality test is at the heart of the fundamental rights analysis. We will look at how proportionality varies according to different constitutional contexts and also look at functional equivalents in jurisdictions that have not adopted the proportionality test. The final part looks at a very recent phenomenon where states are increasingly challenged before domestic courts to strengthen their commitment to mitigate climate change."
LAW4037,Employment Law and Regulations in Singapore,"Employment is an integral part of every economy and to the livelihood of most people.  The employment law landscape in each jurisdiction is unique, being shaped by a myriad of influences ranging from the government to employers, employees, unions and even prevailing societal and political views.  What are the rights and obligations of employers and employees, how do both employers and employees alike protect their own interests, to what extent does the law assist them in doing so and if not, what recourse do they have    these are just some of the few questions that students will be asked to reflect upon and answer.

This course will introduce students to the various legal aspects of employment law in Singapore including employment related statutes like the Employment Act, Employment of Foreign Manpower Act and the Central Provident Fund Act to the law on restrictive covenants and confidential information.  The course will also examine industrial relations in Singapore and the role of the government and relevant government agencies and authorities in shaping the employment law landscape in Singapore."
LAW4038,Artificial Intelligence and Law,"Algorithms have found their way into courtrooms, college admission committees, and human resource departments. Defendants and other disappointed parties have challenged the use of algorithms on the basis of due process and equal protection. This course examines how common-law American courts have applied these legal doctrines to limit (or expand) the use of algorithms by governments and other entities. Students will first analyze existing constitutional rules that were fashioned prior to the rise of algorithms, and then examine how courts apply those rules to contemporary cases involving algorithmic allocation of rights and resources. Throughout the course, we will consider whether existing law is sufficient for the new technological environment."
LAW4039,Community Based Projects in the Real World,"This course provides students with a unique opportunity to undertake projects to help community partners and non-profit organisations on issues relevant to the organisation. Such projects can include matters relating to access to justice, family law, succession law, criminal law, corporate governance and charities law.

The exact scope of work and the community partners / non-profit organisations involved will change each year in accordance to the needs of the organisation served and to ensure the relevance of the experiential learning."
LAW4040,International Investment Law and Dispute Resolution,"International investment is widely recognized as a powerful catalyst of global economic growth.  Therefore, great efforts have been made, by means of investment treaties and domestic regulations, to secure the administration and protection of international investment. Among these efforts, the dispute resolution mechanism is an essential one. The goal of this course to provide an overview of
laws regulating international investment, and to examine the available dispute resolution mechanisms and their possible reforms."
LAW4041,International Anti-Corruption Compliance Law and Practice,"To better serve clients or assist them to develop effective compliance frameworks and internal controls, it is imperative that both dispute resolution and transactional lawyers practicing anywhere in the world be familiar with the ambit of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ) and the UK Bribery Act.

The extraterritoriality of the FCPA and the UK Bribery Act has serious consequences for individuals and corporations (including non-US / UK persons, and subsidiaries) operating anywhere in the world. The sanctions imposed by the US Department of Justice / the US Securities Exchange Commission and the UK Serious Fraud Office typically run in the tens of millions of dollars. Notably, between 2010 and 2021, the monetary penalties imposed exceeded US$15 billion dollars.

Against this backdrop, this course examines the prohibitions, rules and standards that govern transnational corruption laws and anti-bribery compliance law and practice.

The course will start by generally examining the ethos and expectations of the key regulators / enforcers before reviewing the FCPA and UK Bribery Act. It will also consider the importance of internal controls and the components of an effective anti-bribery compliance ( ABC ) program. We then examine the use of deferred prosecution agreements, and non-prosecution agreements by regulators. We go on to analyse case studies of instances of corruption (e.g., Siemens AG, Rolls Royce, Goldman Sachs etc). In the last part of the course, we consider the need to create and implement internal controls and ABC programs that go beyond the letter of the law (e.g., codes of ethics, social responsibility standards, and the creation of institutional culture of compliance)."
LAW4042,Sustainability Law,"In recent years, sustainability has become a popular buzzword in society. The need for sustainable development is quickly emerging as an area of focus among businesses, organisations, governments and the media.   This course will introduce students to the fascinating intersections between the practice of sustainability and various streams of law and policy.  Students will gain exposure to a range of current developments involving sustainability in the real world locally and globally, while reflecting on current laws and policies that address them."
LAW4043,The Singapore International Arbitration Centre and Institutional Arbitration: Law and Practice,"Arbitral institutions are important stakeholders in the field of international arbitration, but the nature and importance of their role have often been overlooked. The course seeks to introduce participants to the role and function of arbitral institutions in guiding and shaping the practice and development of international arbitration, and to the complex issues that arbitral institutions face in the administration of arbitrations, including, among others, the appointment of arbitrators and the issuance of arbitral rules and practice notes.

In this connection, SIAC has grown to be one of the most popular arbitral institutions not just in Asia, but the world. The course involves a study of SIAC processes as well as related case law emanating therefrom. Participants will learn not just what the relevant rules, procedures and processes are, but more importantly, participants will gain insight into why those rules exist, and how those rules are implemented in practice.

Participants will be taught by experienced guest instructors from the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) and by other leading arbitration practitioners, who will share their unique, practical perspectives on administering or advancing a particular case.  After each session involving SIAC instructors, participants will solidify their understanding through a review of case law and class presentations.   Participants keen on developing a practice in international dispute resolution will find this course of direct relevance."
LAW4044,Consumer Law in Australasia,"This course compares and assesses key developments in consumer protection law and practice in East Asia, especially Japan and Southeast Asia, in wider regional (including Australian) and global contexts. It focuses on product safety law, consumer contracts, consumer credit and financial services, and consumer redress. Throughout the course we will also consider regulatory enforcement, and the impact of new technologies and the COVID-19 pandemic. There will be opportunities for class discussion around various scenarios involving disputes between individual consumers and suppliers, as well as small businesses and other businesses when covered by  consumer  law."
LAW4045,FinTech: Law and Policy,"This course provides an overview of the foundations, evolution and regulatory challenges of financial technologies ( FinTech ) and how the rise of blockchain, Artificial Intelligence and other emerging technologies are reshaping the financial services industry. For that purpose, it starts by analysing different regulatory strategies to promote financial innovation and how countries are competing to become a FinTech Hub. The course will then examine the regulatory developments that try to mitigate the risks of the cryptoassets industry for the financial system and for investors and consumers, as well as the remaining gaps in the regulatory discussion worldwide. The future of money and payment systems is an additional component of this course that will analyse the different regulatory strategies to modernise the digital payments ecosystem by promoting innovation, more competition and regulating the entrance of payment services providers outside the traditional payment methods offered in the banking sector.

Thus, two highly practice-oriented topics   Competition: Illegal Agreements; and Competition: Abuse of Dominance and Mergers   will be analyzed."
LAW4047,Commercial Law in Asia,"The emergence of Asia as an economic powerhouse is driving enormous interest in doing business in the region. This subject provides students with an opportunity to examine commercial law in an Asian context. Although parallels can be drawn between Asian jurisdictions in terms of their economic and legal development, their commercial law systems are too diverse to be treated uniformly. Instead, the principal objective of this course is to provide a focused analysis of selected legal and practical issues from comparative and economic perspectives.

In order to facilitate comparative analysis both across and within the common law and civil law traditions, this subject will focus on commercial law in the four jurisdictions of China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. Basic economic principles will be introduced and utilized to evaluate the efficacy of the respective legal rules. Covered topics will include contract, business associations, corporate finance, and taxation. The subject will be of interest to those interested in doing business in Asia."
LAW4048,Comparative Secured Transactions Law,"This is an intensive course taught over 6 weeks.

LAW4049,Advanced Law of Torts,"This course explores advanced topics within the law of obligations, with a focus on the law of tort. The first part focuses on substantive law, including examination of torts not covered in the compulsory curriculum, and close examination of fresh aspects and new authorities within torts with which students are familiar. The second part of the course is thematic, building upon prior learning of tort to make connections and explore differences.

The focus throughout is on the respective laws of tort in Singapore and England & Wales, but with appropriate reference to other leading common law jurisdictions throughout the module. There will be detailed consideration of the relevance of torts in the commercial context. Academic analysis will inform the study of real-world challenges, including the response of tort doctrine to new technologies."
LAW4050,The Law and Finance of Corporate Transactions,"This course seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the legal and financial aspects of corporate transactions, with a particular focus on Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), mergers and acquisitions, going private transactions, private equity, venture capital, project finance, and corporate restructuring. It will also analyse the role of transactional lawyers when advising private companies and different actors in capital markets, including listed companies, hedge funds, institutional investors and boards of directors.

The course will lay foundations for students to imagine a future governance regime that could secure a healthy ocean for humanity."
LAW4053,Overseas Project Experience (Non-Asia),"Businesses do not operate in a vacuum but in a social, economic, and legal context. The legal environment is particularly important given the fact that substantial economic value is captured by contracts as well as a range of intellectual property rights, and credible enforcement of such contractual and property rights have significant impacts on management and entrepreneurship decisions. The aim is to provide a contextual examination and deeper understanding of law-making, judicial institutions, legal practice and law-related bodies in that country and how they relate to the conduct of business.

Through the Overseas Project Experience (OPE) the student is expected to gain an appreciation of the formation, practice and application of law, and the legal institutions and culture in their wider business context within the foreign system. The OPE aims to expose students to these aspects when they visit and engage in participant observation and interviews of firms, legal institutions and businesses overseas as well as stakeholders, including governmental agencies. The purpose of the course includes exposure to the most critical issues of international business and entrepreneurship in the city that is part of the OPE."
LAW4054,Singapore Competition Policy and Law,"Antitrust, competition or anti-monopoly laws aim to prevent or discourage businesses from engaging in anticompetitive behaviour. From the enactment of the Sherman Act (1890) in the United States until the 1970s, competition laws existed only in a handful of industrialized countries. In the last few decades, however, many countries around the world have adopted competition policies and established independent competition authorities. Over 130 jurisdictions have adopted competition laws. The OECD observed that Asia-Pacific region witness an increase in the importance of competition policy and law over the past 20 years.
This course aims to introduce students to the competition policy and law landscape in Singapore.

The course will also refer to Singapore's seminal competition law cases issued by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore, as well as the Competition Appeals Board. Students will also be given an overview of sectoral competition law regimes in Singapore administered by the Infocomm Media Development Authority, and the Energy Market Authority."
LAW4055,"Introduction to Large Language Models, GPT and Legal Technology","Large language models (LLMs) are the driving-force behind some of the latest technology advancements such as OpenAI s ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing s new chat search, and Google s Bard. These LLM-powered applications have demonstrated the impressive ability to produce natural, fluent text in response to user inputs on a diverse range of topics, leading to claims that this will herald another breakthrough in artificial intelligence and change how we work in ways we did not think possible.

In this course, we will study these LLMs in detail by exploring the way they are trained and evaluating their capabilities through reviewing research papers and hands-on testing. We will also discuss the risks and concerns associated with the use of LLMs as they are being deployed into an increasing number of applications, driven largely by a combination of ease-of-use and impressive performance. We will explore how these LLMs are currently being used in legal technology and consider how they could impact the future direction of the legal profession.

By the end of this course, student should be able to:
  Understand the fundamental concepts behind LLMs
  Explore the various applications of LLMs in real-world scenarios
  Evaluate the ethical, social and legal implications of LLMs
  Develop an informed perspective on the future of LLMs and their role in shaping the practice of law

While some of the topics in the course may come across as being technical, prior knowledge is not required. Any experience in using or experimenting with applications such as OpenAI s ChatGPT will likely be helpful. For the group project, students will form their own groups of 2 (or 3) and evaluate OpenAI s ChatGPT or other models such as GPT-3.5."
LAW4056,Civil Litigation Pre-trial Advocacy,"Without good pre-trial work, your case at trial will be prejudiced or in the worst case there may not even be a trial. There are two main components for the course: exposure to pre-trial work (for example, knowledge of and working with pleadings and applications), and oral advocacy. There is much content including substantive and procedural law (only selected areas will be covered) and designing an effective strategy so that your best case may be facilitated and presented at trial. The skills-based aspect of learning is also found in the oral advocacy training in arguing pre-trial applications (for example, a summary judgment application)."
LAW4057,Comparative Arbitration in East Asia,"International commercial arbitration is a preferred means of dispute resolution by parties to international commercial transactions. Around 70 per cent of international commercial arbitration in the world is seated in Asia. This is unsurprising considering that the People s Republic of China (PRC), South Korea and Japan are among the top ten biggest economies in the world and companies from these countries are the leading users of international arbitration.  This course examines the law and practice of international commercial arbitration in these civil law countries. Topics that will be covered include jurisdictional issues, arbitrability, the validity of arbitration agreement, principles to determine the applicable law, arbitral tribunals and institutions, arbitration procedure, interim and final awards, and the court s role in relation to arbitration. Each topic covered in this course will involve a comparative study of laws and practices in the PRC, Korea, and Japan. Students will be exposed to case law relating to arbitral awards and relevant court decisions from the respective civil law jurisdictions. Laws and practices from the common law jurisdictions will be referred to for the purpose of comparison where necessary."
LAW4058,Corporate Deals,"This is a capstone course that builds upon the foundational legal knowledge acquired by students in their earlier years in law school, in particular the basic principles of contract and corporation. It is also an SMU-X course that approaches the topic through practical problem-solving. It is designed to provide students with a contextual understanding of the major types of corporate deals and an opportunity to tackle problems arising from these deals. The course is divided into two parts.

In the second part, students will work on a venture capital investment project under the guidance of our industrial partner, Linklaters."
LAW4059,Understanding Law in Context: A Multidisciplinary Approach,"In a rapidly evolving world, the study of law extends beyond statutes and courtrooms.

This course invites students to explore the dynamic relationship between law and society. Specifically, the course will delve into the intersections of law, human behavior, public policy, economic insights, and emerging AI/technologies. We will examine how economic principles shape legal systems, how behavioral phenomena influence decision-making, how public policy impacts our society, and how AI and emerging technologies impact the (future of) law.

By discussing some of the most pressing challenges society faces students will develop critical thinking skills and better appreciation of the context in which law and legal systems operate.

This course assumes no prior knowledge in non-legal disciplines, making it accessible for all students seeking to broaden their legal and meta-legal horizons."
LAW4060,"Artificial Intelligence Law, Policy and Ethics","In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force with profound implications for society, industry and governments.

LAW4061,Introduction to Sustainability Law,"In recent years, sustainability has become a popular buzzword in society. The need for sustainable development is quickly emerging as an area of focus among businesses, organisations, governments and the media.  This course will introduce students to the fascinating environmental, economic and social dimensions and intersections for sustainability and various streams of law and policy. Students will gain exposure to a range of current developments involving sustainability locally and globally, while reflecting on current laws and policies that address them.

This course serves as a good stepping stone to the more in-depth exploration of selected sustainability issues in other electives, such as LAW4052 Sustainable Ocean Law and Governance and COR-LAW2225 Governing for Sustainable Futures."
LAW4062,International Energy Disputes,"The energy industry is a significant player in the international dispute resolution sphere, spanning across investor-state, public international law, commercial and construction-related disputes. The course seeks to equip students with an in-depth understanding of issues relating to energy disputes, from both a substantive and practical perspective.

Participants will be introduced to the key features of energy projects and investments, the parties involved, and some of the unique characteristics of disputes arising in the energy sector. The course also involves a study of investment protection treaties and instruments in the energy sector, and related case law in international arbitration arising therefrom. Participants will then gain an understanding of the various strategic considerations on handling cross-border energy disputes, including how to prevent them from the outset, and managing a dispute across each stage of the dispute resolution process.

Participants learn from leading practitioners who are experienced in navigating energy disputes, as well as guest instructors in the energy industry, who will share practical perspectives on the intersection between commercial and legal considerations. Participants will apply their knowledge through class presentations and group discussions. Participants keen on developing a practice specializing in energy disputes, and in particular, energy arbitration and gas/LNG price reviews, will find this course of direct relevance."
LAW4063,Advanced Legal Writing: Student Publishing,"This SMU-X course will give SMU law students opportunities to work alongside graduate mentors to produce high-quality legal articles for publication. As well as enhancing their legal knowledge, students will hone their writing and editing skills, learning to communicate their analysis in a manner which is helpful to both lawyers and non-lawyers. This will also help students develop their body of work as they move from school into practice.

Students can choose their topics from a curated list of topics, or propose their own ideas (ideally involving issues of practical significance, analysis of which would be helpful to practitioners and/or the general public).  They will work closely together with their graduate mentor on their articles, crafting their work and receiving feedback and comments on a pre-agreed schedule. Students can also build up their networking skills through these mentorships.

At the end of the course, students will have produced one article of around 5,000 words. The students can submit their papers to the Singapore Law Journal or other reputable publications."
LGST232,The Law and Information Technology in Asia: Developments and Issues,"Participants will be introduced to the many legal issues and problems that arise from and relate to modern developments in Information and Communications Technology. ICT is changing the socio-economic environment and the way we behave and transact on a global scale. Terms such as  the gig economy ,  disruptive innovations ,  big data ,  social media  and  the Internet of Things  describe some of these changes.

In relation to the law in this area, Asia has only more recently begun to catch up on the laws to deal with these issues. For example, Singapore has released many new and amended laws within the last decade alone that relate to infocomm developments. More recent amendments include changes to the Electronic Transactions Act of 2010 relating to e-contracts, e-signature and intermediary liability; the enactment of the Personal Data Protection Act in 2012 relating to data protection, the do-not-call registry and the Spam Control Act; changes to content regulations, specifically the class licensing regulations in 2013; the Protection from Harassment Act of 2014 and amendments to the Copyright Act in 2014 and 2016. In 2018, the Singapore legislature is expected to produce more new laws to deal with the fake news phenomenon and electric payment systems as well as in the areas of cybersecurity, electronic transactions and data protection.

Other than the legal changes in Singapore, the latest trends and developments in other jurisdictions, with a focus on the Asian region, will be considered where relevant."
LGST101,Business Law,"This is an introductory course designed to help business students acquaint themselves with the framework of Singapore s legal system and to understand the legal environment within which businesses operate. A substantial part of the course is dedicated to the study of contractual principles as the making and performance of contracts form the rudiment of all businesses. Apart from the law of contract, students will learn about various types of legal liability (criminal, tortuous and statutory) which may arise in the conduct of business, basic concepts relating to the ownership, use and infringement of intellectual property, as well as common forms of business relationships. To ensure that students are equipped to face the challenges and exploit the opportunities presented by the current e-revolution in commerce, the course also requires students to understand and analyse new legal issues arising from the conduct of businesses through electronic media."
LGST102,The Singapore Legal System and Legal Analysis Skills,"Law is a tool for problem-solving.

c. Legal research and interpretation;
d. Legal writing (advisory and litigation); and
e. Practical application of legal skills to real-world problems."
LGST103,"Governance Through Law In Singapore: Institutions, Jurisprudence, And Values","This course aims to introduce PLE students to how law operates in Singapore. We will explore the role of law in Singapore in the management of both public power and the sphere of private dealings between persons. This will be done through a study of the various sources of law and their nature; the legal institutions and the relations between them; and foundational principles and values.

We will begin by exploring the concept of law and the ideals of constitutionalism, democracy, the rule of law, and the separation of powers   all of which pertain to the ways in which power is defined and limited by law. Besides studying what law is, we will study tools and concepts which have some degree of formality but are not law, such as policies and decisions by those who hold discretionary powers.

Having inquired into these ideas, we will go on to explore the various institutions of the state and their roles, as well as the values that animate them. This is important because law does not put itself into action; legal institutions breathe life into laws by interpreting them, executing them, and serving as sites of contestation as to how they are to be interpreted and executed. We will discuss matters such as different modes of lawmaking and their relative advantages and disadvantages; the role of the state in controlling its own power; and the limits to law as a means of governing society. Finally, we will apply all this knowledge by focusing our attention on a few discrete areas of law as case studies.

While this course will focus on Singapore, comparisons will be drawn with other legal systems, particularly the UK s, when appropriate."
LGST201,Company Law,"The corporate form is the most widely used legal structure for the operation and conduct of business. It deals with a web of different interests and the rights and obligations of a number of stakeholders. As such it is a highly complex structure and the most regulated of all business entities.

This course will cover the main body of laws that regulate the operational aspects of companies embodied in the Companies Act. Where appropriate and relevant, these laws will be considered from the different perspectives of the various interest groups in a corporate structure. The course will also attempt to acquaint the student with the primary issues that are raised in the management of companies. Topics include current issues in corporate governance, the external regulation of corporate matters, the duties of corporate managers, directors and other officers, the law and practice of meetings and legal issues relating to corporate restructuring. The difficulties relating to transactions with other parties, which are peculiar to companies, will also be covered, including corporate contracting and insolvency. The course will also touch upon the ongoing law reform in this area.

Upon the completion of this course, the student should  
- understand the legal framework within which companies operate;
- appreciate the different interest groups within the corporate framework;
- understand the dynamics of majority control and minority shareholder rights;
- appreciate the extent of and understand the legal duties and responsibilities expected of management; and
- have a basic understanding of issues pertaining to corporate finance and securities regulation."
LGST203,Intellectual Property Rights,"In this course, students will be introduced to the different types of intellectual property rights and the various branches of intellectual property law which, on the one hand, confer protection and, on the other, ensure compliance. Some of these rights include copyright, patent and trade mark rights. We will also have the opportunity to examine, in some detail, the common law actions of passing off and breach of confidence."
LGST210,Risk and Regulations in Real Estate,"This course focuses on the legal fundamentals of real estate practice and development in Singapore. While space and the built environment is ubiquitous, real estate remains a unique asset class. The rules relating to its current and future value, how it may be securely transferred from one party to another and its very definition all depend on law. The course is vital for students with an interest in real estate transactions, its development, investment and financing.

The primary topics covered include the nature of real property, contract and property torts, interests in property, development and construction, the rules relating to securitisation and taxes affecting property. It is one of the foundational courses of the Real Estate Track offered in LKCSB and SOE in Singapore Management University."
LGST223,Law of International Trade,"The results of sale transactions are all around us. Most goods   such as the chair you may be sitting on, the computer from which you may be reading this, and the food you may have recently eaten - have reached consumers and business organizations as a result of sales. The buying and selling of goods is a fundamental aspect of domestic and international business, and Singapore is a well-known centre of trade, as a consumer of both local and foreign goods. Given that sale transactions are a common part of daily life, a sound understanding of the law regulating sales is important for an entrepreneur and for the management of resources in organizations.

This course will provide an overview of the rules that apply to sale transactions, an understanding of major differences between domestic and international sales, common trade terms, and major methods of financing sales and of transporting goods across borders. It will also provide an understanding of the wider national and international environments in which international trade takes place, including product liability laws, major methods of resolving trade disputes, and important regulatory issues, such as WTO rules, and laws on customs, competition, technology transfer and security."
LGST233,Health Law and Medical Ethics,"This course covers issues relating to health/medical law such as medical negligence, consent to treatment, confidentiality, and the Mental Capacity Act.  It will also explore ethical theories pertinent to the practice of medicine and the Singapore Medical Council s Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines 2016, as well as certain legal and ethical issues relating to reproduction and end-of-life."
LGST234,The Legal Environment of Business: An Asian Perspective,"Law does not exist in a vacuum, and neither do businesses  law provides the backbone upon which businesses operate. Armed with some basic knowledge, entrepreneurs should be able to better structure their businesses, avoid common legal pitfalls, and identify potential problems, and take appropriate actions, both before and after the problems arise. A failure to understand  at least rudimentarily  the impact of the legal landscape and certain legal developments on business transactions often has dire consequences.

This is an introductory course designed to help acquaint students  who may be future business owners or managers  with the legal environment within which businesses operate and the common legal issues one may face when doing business in Asia, with a particular emphasis on Singapore. The course will entail not only classroom teaching and learning, but will also include invaluable sharing sessions guest speakers from various relevant fields, as well as field trips to legal institutions and/or offices in Singapore.

A substantial part of the course will be dedicated to exploring, at a general level, various aspects of laws pertaining to doing business, with an especial focus on business organisations and commercial transactions.

With cross-border business dealings being the norm instead of the exception, an understanding of the implications of contractual clauses in international contracts, and of the avenues for the resolution of international disputes, also become essential.

Because business relationships with commercial parties are primarily governed by contract, an understanding of how contracts work is important. Basic principles of contract law (e.g. the making and performance of contracts), as well as laws applying to specific situations (e.g. the sale of goods and services), will be taught in brief. Students will also be introduced to the law of torts and will, in particular, learn the essentials of the very pervasive tort of negligence, and the often-misunderstood tort of defamation."
LGST235,China's Belt and Road Initiative: Challenges and Opportunities,"Initially two obscure projects (The Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-century Maritime Silk Road) announced in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has quickly become the centre-piece of China s economic diplomacy over the past few years. Spanning across Asia, Europe and Africa, the project is often called the  Marshall Plan  of China as it aims to promote the economic development of the
less-developed countries in the three continents.

Taught by an advisor to the WTO and the Chinese government, this course will provide an in-depth analysis for the background for the BRI, the detailed strategy of China in each areas covered such as trade and investment, and how the BRI might result in an alternative economic order led by China."
LGST236,Financial Crime,"This course will introduce students to key issues in domestic and international financial crime. It begins with the basic principles of criminal law in Singapore. Students will also learn how evidence is obtained in the course of investigations and how that evidence may be used to charge and convict offenders in court. The course will then progress to cover the major types of financial crime, such as: (1) cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal misappropriation of property; (2) corruption; (3) market misconduct: insider trading and market manipulation; (4) tax evasion; and (5) money laundering and terrorist financing. Efforts to combat international financial crime, e.g. the setting up of the Financial Action Task Force, anti-money laundering procedures, and mutual legal assistance and exchange of information regimes, will also be discussed in this course.

This course will be taught with its main audience in mind, namely, students taking a second major in Financial Forensics offered by the School of Accountancy."
LGST237,"Sustainability, Multinational Corporations and International Economic Law","Sustainable development has become a key concept for the 21st century and has been endorsed and recognised in a number of instruments of international law. Problems like global climate change, high pollution levels and depletion of living and non-living natural resources are becoming important restraints on the global economy. These sustainability challenges will reshape the global economy. The transition to a greener, more sustainable economic system will require collective action by governments, international organizations, multinational corporations, and civil society. 

This course reviews the principles and rules underlying the post-war international economic order, in particular with respect to trade, foreign investment and finance, as well as some of its key institutions, such as the World Bank and the World Trade Organization. The course reviews the role of international economic agreements in pursuing sustainable development."
LGST601,Professional Ethics and CFA Ethics,"Participants will develop an appreciation and understanding of business, financial and professional ethics. This course explores responsibility from competing theoretical and management perspectives. It will also analyze conflict situations in the various personal, corporate and professional settings, and how to avoid and manage these conflicts. Topics includes prudent financial management, product safety, corporate responsibility and the implementation of CFA ethical standards."
LGST603,Legal Environment of Business,"This course is designed to help business students acquaint themselves with the framework of Singapore's legal system and to understand the legal environment within which businesses operate. A substantial part of the course is dedicated to the study of contractual principles as the making and performance of contracts form the rudiment of all businesses. In addition, this course will also cover the main body of laws that regulate the operational aspects of companies embodied in the Companies Act."
LGST605,Financial Advisers Law and Compliance,"This course aims to give participants a good appreciation of the law as it affects providing financial advice, marketing of financial products and compliance.

The first part of the course assists participants to understand the law. It will address the regulatory framework imposed by statute and relevant authorities, including the Financial Advisers Act, MAS Notices, Guidelines and other publications. It also discusses tort, contract law, negligence, fiduciary duties of client advisers and consumer rights. It also addresses misrepresentation and non-reliance clauses. Participants will also be introduced to agency law, conflict of laws and the interplay between the regulatory law, tort law and contract law.

The second part of this course will also provide an ethical and practical approach to compliance and risk in view of heightened regulatory requirements that impact wealth managers. Regulatory framework and regulations such as Anti Money Laundering, Fair Dealing and Tax O ences will be introduced to discuss issues relevant to the wealth management industry, and strategy for Singapore as a wealth centre, private banks and trust companies, and for individuals seeking to make a career in the industry. In addition, different types of risks that can impact the wealth management business, and how such risks can be managed with renewed rigour in areas such as client suitability, enhanced due diligence in client onboarding will be addressed."
LGST607,Corporate Governance and Ethics,"Ethical and socially responsible conduct and corporate governance are treated with increasing importance and prominence by the corporate world, governments, the public, and other stakeholders globally. The reputation and success of organizations (and individuals associated with them) are increasingly and intricately linked with the level of ethical conduct, social responsibility and accountability to a varied range of stakeholders.

It is also increasingly evident that society and governments expect the business world to behave ethically and be socially responsible, with self-regulation and norm-generation being favoured approaches in dealing with the impact of business on various aspects of our lives.

This course aims to sensitise participants to the issues and concerns of business ethics and social responsibility, and to a lesser extent, corporate governance. It seeks to equip participants with the conceptual tools and thinking/ethical processes by which decisions are made and evaluated when businesses/individuals are confronted with ethical and moral dilemmas. Corporate governance is enhanced if it moves away from a compliance mindset to one where a business entity conducts its business activities in an enlightened manner.

Although this is an academic course with real world relevance, it is certainly not intended to make  saints  out of  sinners  or to propose the merits of a virtuous life. What it aspires towards is to engage and sensitise participants in critically evaluating the trends, societal concerns and expectations while encouraging participants to develop a personal perspective about ethics informed by rigorous and nuanced understanding of the knowledge and theoretical approaches in business and professional life."
LGST608,"Business Sustainability, Intellectual Property and Value Extraction","This course addresses the issues of intellectual property (IP) in the pursuit of capturing value. The general order of topics is: 1+2. Introduction to Intellectual Property (IP) Rights I and II; 3. How Firms Can Use IP To Extract Value: Case Study Analyses and Presentations; 4. Legal Perspective I: Different Types of IP-Related Contracts; 5. Legal Perspective II: IP Due Diligence in Corporate Transaction; 6. IP   Value Extraction: An R&D Perspective; 7. IP   Value Extraction: Examples of Value Extraction through Technological Innovation and Commercialisation; 8. Legal Perspective III: IP Management and Litigation. This course will examine the different ways in which value may be extracted from the ownership of intellectual property rights (IPRs) and provide an understanding of the threats and opportunities that IPRs provide to all businesses.

The course will start with a general introduction into intellectual property rights (IPR s) which are important when considering the development of an effective IP management and valuation cum extraction strategy. We will also look at the legal underpinnings and the proper management of IP rights (IPRs) in the context of their commercialisation. The course will look at ways of exploiting different IPRs and the different challenges they present. We will consider how to and why it is necessary to conduct IP due diligence in corporate transactions, and participants will be taken through some practical steps that should be employed to undertake this effectively. Further, this course will show how technological and business innovations enable creation of sustainable wealth & value and outline strategies for extracting them. In continuation, it will examine practical examples of innovations to understand how they can create remarkable value. Importantly, we will consider the critical role IPRs play in extracting enterprise value.

Based on various case studies, participants will be guided through the processes, tools and standards through which enterprises can engage in innovation, effective IPR management, commercialisation and, ultimately, value extraction.

The goal of this course is to introduce you to the real, practical considerations and opportunities involved in the management, commercialisation and effective exploitation of IPRs so that you are better able to deal with the issues as they arise and better recognise and manage these when they do."
LGST609,Legal Issues and Risks in Business,"Just as the business world is very complex, the laws affecting business are also very complex. Yet it is critical for the CFO (and other members of senior management) of a corporation to have a good understanding, and some level of mastery, of the key legal issues and risks in business. This will help the corporation to optimise its rights and minimize its liabilities, and thereby enhance the corporation s financial position. The field of law is very wide. In this course, we focus on the fundamentals and the critical concepts and problems. The topics covered are: introduction to law (including business model protection), negligence liability, contract law, corporate law (including agency law) and international aspects."
LGST611,Legal Issues and Risks in Business,"Just as the business world is very complex, the laws affecting business are also very complex. Yet it is critical for the CFO (and other members of senior management) of a corporation to have a good understanding, and some level of mastery, of the key legal issues and risks in business. This will help the corporation to optimise its rights and minimize its liabilities, and thereby enhance the corporation s financial position. The field of law is very wide. In this course, we focus on the fundamentals and the critical concepts and problems. The topics covered are: introduction to law, negligence liability, contract law, law relating to intermediaries (or agency law), corporate law and international aspects."
LGST612,"Intellectual Property, Data and Innovation","This course is an introduction to intellectual property rights (IPRs), and their relationship to the knowledge economy. In a world where everything from songs to seeds, and colours to shapes, can be protected (and copied), a basic understanding of IPRs is essential. This course examines the various categories of rights, and the different threats and opportunities that they present for businesses. It also considers the extent to which IPRs can foster or hinder creativity and innovation.

During this course, we will differentiate the types of IPRs (such as patent, copyright, and trademark), and understand their strategic value in a commercial context. We will demystify basic terminology and debunk the key misconceptions and myths that exist. We will also explore diverse conceptual frameworks and approaches to thinking about ownership vs. licensing, proprietary vs. open source, and offense vs. defense. It is often said that IPRs can be both sword and shield: we will consider practical examples that demonstrate this duality, as well as the related tactical considerations for start-ups as well as established enterprises.

The goal of this course is to introduce you to core concepts and practical considerations involved in the creation and management of IPRs, so that you are better able to deal with potential issues as they arise. It should help you ask important questions and weigh in on IP policies and approaches at your workplace."
LGST700A,Legal Knowledge & Strategy for Senior Management,"Just as the business world is very complex, the laws affecting business are also very complex. Yet, it is necessary for the senior management of a corporation to have a good understanding, and in fact some level of mastery, of the law in order that they may not just comply with but also leverage the law to their advantage. The field of law is very wide. In this course, we focus on the fundamentals and the critical concepts and problems. The topics covered are: introduction to law, corporate law, transactional law, negligence liability, law relating to intermediaries and international aspects."
MGMT104,Corporate Entrepreneurship and Innovation,"Large, established corporations face fundamentally different innovation challenges than new or young small firms. The routinization of practices, obsolescence of such routines and dominant logic that may be misaligned with changes in the environment subject large firms to great difficulties in innovating. Further, revenue cannibalization with existing products and the politics of allocating scarce resources away from established, competing product divisions afflict how new ventures are created within large corporations.  These issues have few parallels in new, small firms.  In view of typically bureaucratic hierarchies in large corporations, it is important for students to understand how to design and manage innovation systems for large corporations, as well as how to lead corporate entrepreneurship."
MGMT205,International Business,"International Business is the study of the cross-border trade, investments and corporate functions by firms, and the role of national governments and international institutions in regulating these activities.  The course examines the objectives and strategies by multinationals in internationalization and the strategic choices in country locations, market entry, product/service offerings, organisational structure & human resource management.  Related topics include the international business environment (economic, cultural, political, legal), globalisation, foreign direct investments, licensing, franchising, foreign entry modes, strategic alliances, and regional economic integration.  The course will demonstrate the challenges for business and management in an international environment."
MGMT206,Intelligent Organisations,"The course aims to nurture an intelligence mindset in interested students by introducing some basic concepts of Chaos, Complexity Theory (Complex Adaptive System) and Intelligent Organization Theory such as consciousness, intelligence, complexity, connectivity, dissipation, emergence, autopoiesis, self-organization, biodiversity, rugged landscape and dialogue, and how they can be better exploited by human/business organizations to increase their competitiveness in a knowledge-intensive and fast changing environment. The complex adaptive dynamics of the human thinking systems and their organizations, the nonlinearity of intelligence, and intelligence management will also be discussed. The concept of organizing around intelligence   the complexity-intelligence strategy and the significance of nurturing an intelligent organization with a biotic structure that encompasses an intense intelligence source (orgmind) will also be studied (intelligent organization theory). Additional significant and critical CAS/IO properties such as the edge of chaos, the butterfly effect, the red queen race, smarter evolvers, longer-term gain and their relationships with risk-taking, sustainability, and innovation and creativity will be explained. Ultimately, the course will cover the new and more holistic thinking/planning, such as the integrated deliberate and emergent strategy, and the intelligence leadership and management theory."
MGMT222,Family Business,"Family businesses are the most prevalent form of business in the world. It is also an emerging and vibrant area of interest today among academics, practitioners and students of management. This course explores the unique challenges and opportunities involves in ownership and management of family businesses. Key family, ownership and management issues relevant to the management and continuity of these enterprises will be covered. Topics in this course include the uniqueness of family business, succession, governance, working with non-family managers, communication, strategy and continuity.

This course will be useful to students from business-owning families. As most of the business organizations in Asia are family-owned, this course will also benefit students who may work for a family business in the course of their future career. Students who wish to enter the private banking, wealth management, corporate banking and consulting industry will find knowledge gained in this course helpful to their work. Anyone who thinks the interaction of two somewhat mutually exclusive systems   the family and the business - difficult will find this course fascinating."
MGMT223,Sustainable Entrepreneurship,"Sustainable entrepreneurship is an area of importance globally as communities, institutions, and individuals seek to find new ways to address societal needs that are not met by, or inadequately provided for, by government and society. In this course, you will learn concepts, frameworks, and practical skills to strategize, organize, and take action to address societal needs through a commercial enterprise. This course is designed for students who are primarily interested in organizing to create local, regional, or international impact by addressing societal issues such as poverty, inequality, hunger, exploitation, social mobility, and educational access."
MGMT233,Leadership Seminar with CEOs,"This course is designed to give students opportunities to interact with about 10 CEOs/MDs during the semester. The invited speakers will share with students their views on leadership and management.

Before each CEO session, class will meet to analyze the transforming power of leadership and how its practice changes individuals, organizations and societies.  Students will examine different perspectives of leadership in the business world as well as in politics and the arts.   They will learn how leadership is developed in different organizational and cultural settings and how it is portrayed in different media including films, plays and novels.

Are great leaders born or made? Can training or coaching make a difference? This course analyses the transforming power of leadership and how its practice changes individuals, organizations and societies. It seeks to expose students to different perspectives of leadership in the business world as well as in politics and the arts.

It will examine how leadership is developed in different organizational and cultural settings and how it is portrayed in different media including films, plays and novels. The focus of the course will not be on the identification of critical leadership traits or tasks but on the interactions between a leader, the organization and the context in which leadership evolves. Weekly CEO talks will form an integral part of the course."
MGMT234,Strategic Management in China,"The primary topic of this course is strategic management in the Chinese context, including that of both local Chinese companies and foreign companies operating in China, but with a somewhat greater focus on the former. The course has two primary features. First, it broadly encompasses three levels of strategies of companies competing in the Chinese context: business strategies, corporate strategies, and cross-border competitive strategies. Second, in analyzing the strategies of companies competing in the Chinese context, the course will take a comparative perspective. The key frameworks in strategic management are mostly developed in the West. Since there are fundamental differences in macro national environment, competitive industry, and firm strategic issues between China and the West, whether the existing frameworks are applicable to the Chinese context is thus a key concern. We shall discuss throughout the course the similarities and differences between strategic management issues in the West and in China."
MGMT235,Sustainability Management and Governance,"This course provides an introduction to environmental sustainability and human development issues, and the means of framing, analysing and solving such problems. As environmental and social problems mount around the world, firms have become more attuned to the need to devise new products, services and strategies, and to communicate these to a variety of stakeholders, even as they cooperate with them.

Environmental sustainability, and more generally, sustainability, has become increasingly important to developed and developing nations alike. Typical issues include resource scarcity and polluted environments, but more recently, global climate change has become the primary issue for many. In general, sustainability issues often consist of complex interactions between human activity and the environment. The course will apply several academic perspectives to characterizing these problems and their possible solutions.

The course will focus in particular on businesses  role in causing and addressing sustainability problems and on how they moderate their impacts. An important part of addressing the sustainability of firms is the employment of various concepts and frameworks that help incorporate the sustainability perspective into firms  strategies and operations. To help characterize firms  sustainability and determine appropriate courses of action, the course will cover specific managerial tools and frameworks. The primary focus will be on strategy and business models that support change and its operationalization, but the course will also illustrate the role that  greening  other business functions play in the sustainability of the firm, including those of marketing, supply chains, and financing. The course will review core management frameworks to help non-business major students become familiar with more sustainability-specific frameworks, practices and concepts to be covered. These tools are not only means for improving a firm s sustainability performance, but also support its transparent and effective reporting. Representative examples of sustainability measurement standards will be introduced and their potential impacts in advancing corporate sustainability will be discussed. The course will also reflect on the general role of innovation in all of this. Technology issues covered include the role of information technology in addressing poverty, and solutions that reorganize the industrial system (e.g. renewable energy policies, and industrial ecosystems or industrial symbiosis, i.e., industries that incorporate recycling loops at regional levels)."
MGMT236,Managing Strategic Change and Digital Transformation,"To achieve superior performance in an increasingly dynamic and uncertain global business environment, companies in every industry must create internal capability to harness strategic change for sustainable competitive advantage. However, companies that are able to strategically change their entrenched ways of doing things and then reclaim leading positions are the exception rather than the rule. With the industry 4.0 upon us and fast advancement in digital technologies, firms in many industries would find it even more pressing but challenging to build the managerial capabilities to cope with the digital transformation that will reshape the business landscape tremendously for the future. Against this backdrop, this course discusses how companies can effectively manage the strategic change and digital transformation that will significantly impact the way the business is configured for competitive advantage. Besides the internal managerial challenge, the course also emphasizes that companies must cope with strategic interactions with different industry players to create value collectively and continuously. With respect to digital transformation, the course discusses digital concepts and technologies such as omni-channel, platforms, eco-systems, blockchain, IOT, AI, and cloud computing etc. that impose both challenges and opportunities for strategic change management in the increasingly technology-based, internet-based, and data-based business contexts."
MGMT239,Play in Design and Cultural Invention,"This course will explore how  play  can enhance creative design processes to promote innovation and invention. Play was borne out of not only human desires for leisure and frivolity, but cultural and biological needs such as learning and community bonding. Recently, it has been observed that inventors in history have conceived of new ideas and products, even technological inventions, in a playful manner (Johnson, 2016). Playful invention processes could be serious experimental (and risky) efforts, or playfully frivolous ones. The course will analyze and apply creative and inventive processes, with the focus on how the mind can explore more widely and inventively by becoming less self-conscious and critical through play.

Playful invention facilitates creativity by blending ideas together from different domains, causing  forms  to transcend boundaries, and ultimately, to reshape not only leisure, but other domains and culture itself. This creative blending helps cross-fertilize domains with new ideas. We will examine how inventors  playfully created  in different domains such as narrative, visual arts, space (including architectural space), and games. While most of the cultural domains covered relate to historical and current popular culture, we also pay attention to specific local and  globalized national  cultures.

At least half of the course focuses on the actual practice of techniques that are related to the conceptual study of domains and thinking processes. We will adapt the design thinking process to incorporate additional brainstorming techniques (including domain-specific ideation techniques) and user-centered prototyping while removing the  project client  typically seen in design thinking projects. In addition, we will illustrate and practice how to design using domains as lenses into the design of forms related to those domains.

A significant part of the course will involve a project to design an innovative experience or other  form  using these creativity and design techniques. In-class (or online) group exercises and projects will be used to demonstrate and practice these techniques, and full class attendance is expected in order to participate in these group exercises and group work."
MGMT240,Doing Business with Artificial Intelligence,"More and more business organizations are using A.I. technologies such as predictive analytics, deep learning or sentiment / image analysis to identify patterns and trends in vast reams of (big) data, allowing them to make  smarter  decisions (e.g. about loss of customers or the necessary service inspection of equipment) and potentially to become more competitive in real-time. As A.I. technology is already surpassing human decision- making in certain instances, there is growing concern about  uncontrolled A.I.  in business and society, incl. regulatory and ethical-legal challenges. Against this background, this new course aims to equip students with foundational, theoretical and practical knowledge about A.I. driven business applications in selected private and public sector organizations. At the beginning of the course, students will watch Ex-Machina (2015), a psycho- techno thriller film which tells the story of a young programmer invited to the home of a reclusive billionaire to test whether an A.I. can pass itself off as human to assess the difficulties to successfully control and  switch- off  artificial intelligence once created. Besides reconstructing the history of artificial intelligence from the 1960s to the current era (as well as a refresher about the basics of computer science algorithms such as audio and video compression algorithms), we will put emphasis on explaining the A.I. driven business models of several top international and local organizations such as New Relic, Splunk, Trade Desk, Nvidia, MetaMind, DBS, NTUC, Gov Tech Agency of Singapore and the German Research Center for A.I. In order to appreciate the power of A.I. technology, we will take a closer look  under the A.I. hood  to understand what makes machine learning, deep learning, neural networks and image analysis tick. Visits to A.I. powered business organizations engaged in customer service management, finance, marketing, supply chain management or manufacturing will be organised aimed at appreciating both the benefits and downside of A.I. Students graduating from this course will be equipped with critical competencies to solve real-world business problems using A.I. technology while simultaneously casting a critical eye on the morality and ethics of commercialising A.I."
MGMT243,Negotiating Early Stage Startup Financing,"This course aims to equip aspiring entrepreneurs with a basic toolkit to steer a startup through the quagmire of raising external capital from venture capital investors while protecting the interests of the founding team and your employees. 

Through real-world term sheet negotiation exercises and other practical exercises, students will go through the entire fundraising process from evaluating different external fund-raising opportunities and identifying the appropriate investors for the business, reviewing and negotiating term sheets, scaling up with various stakeholders and navigating a startup to a successful exit.  It aims to put the aspiring student founder on an even playing field when negotiating across and working with sophisticated venture capital investors in building a successful startup that creates value in Southeast Asia s growing startup ecosystem."
MGMT244,Fraud Protection for Entrepreneurs,"This course equips aspiring entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurs, and managers with essential tools for understanding and identifying instances of fraud, with a view to developing a fraud risk management strategy for their new venture. It aims to provide students with a working knowledge of the various types of fraudulent conduct and the legal framework in place to prevent and deter instances of fraud. In addition, to learning from past cases of fraud, the course also explores new forms or methods of fraud that can arise from new technologies."
MGMT299,Special Topics in Management,"This course covers a specific topic related to management and strategy by an instructor who will change from one topic to another. The course chose such topics as Management in Asia Context, Management in Japan, and High-Tech Business Development in the past by the different instructors.  This course caters to students who are interested in topics that are not covered by regular undergraduate courses."
MGMT302,The Games and Digital Media Industries,"This course should be useful to students who want to learn about the forces driving change in emerging creative industries such as videogames, as well as how such products are developed, and how those industries come about. Please note that the course has a heavy theoretical basis. This involves building a deeper understanding of how digital media products like games come about and work. We do this by understanding how creativity, culture, technology, and processes (e.g. product development and organizational) are integrated into these media. This will help to appreciate industry and business issues. In particular, the course discusses the central role of creativity in these selected industries, as well as the factors that influence or constrain this creativity. We draw most of our examples from the video game industry, and to some extent,  digital  media such as social media, but we will also make comparisons with other industries such as IT, design, film, and animation. The course is interdisciplinary, and readings and theories will be drawn from the business, social science, and media studies traditions."
MGMT304,Entrepreneurial Leadership in Ethnic Chinese Business,"Since the mid-1980s intra-regional trade and investment links in East and Southeast Asia have expanded rapidly with the shift of production by firms from Japan and newly industrializing countries to lower-cost, neighboring countries. Ethnic Chinese from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Indonesia are actively involved in these massive transformation and integration processes. The course will scrutinize their role as well as some of the (culturally biased) misperceptions about their business conduct. The degree, to which their extensive business networks succeed because of ethnic characteristics, or simply because of the sound application of good business practice, is a key issue that will be discussed throughout the course. Based on various corporate case studies and a multi-disciplinary explanatory framework, we will assess the role, characteristics and challenges of Chinese entrepreneurship and business networks in the People s Republic of China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia in an era of global market expansion."
MGMT305,Enterprise Consulting,"This course introduces the participants to the process of management consulting and how they can apply the management concepts they have learnt in other courses in practical consulting experiences with SMEs to aid with their development and growth. This course will help participants identify the issues of SMEs such as challenges of survival, opportunity realization, execution of their vision, leadership, recruitment of right people, motivation of staff and gathering critical resources such as capital.

As part of the course, participants will form student consulting teams to a consulting assignment with a SME to identify a business problem and develop a solution and plan to assist the enterprise.

Participants will integrate their learning experiences by creating a plan/project in a role as a consultant to identify the challenges and competition faced by entrepreneurs."
MGMT308,Corporate Governance,"This course is highlight relevant in the light of Enron and Informatics. The course explores the dynamics of power and control within the corporation. It provides the participants insights into how a corporation is governed as opposed to management at the operational level. Accountability and enterprise and how the tension between these two elements is maintained in corporate governance frameworks are discussed in the context of Singapore's Code of Corporate Governance and corporate law. The other topics include the corporation's officers (board, management and other key officers), board accountability, management and board relations and the role of the company auditor and company secretary. The role of directors, their fiduciary obligations and board performance are some aspects of sound corporate governance examined. The course also examines the role of governance on performance particularly on management behaviour. The differences in international corporate governance are also covered."
MGMT310,Leading New Ventures to Growth,"In pursuing a business idea, an important issue for the entrepreneur(s) is how to grow the enterprise.  This course examines various ways in which a business can develop and expand over time, in geography and products.  Drawing from academic studies as well as real-world case studies, this course shows students the range of issues, challenges and outcomes - both projected and real - that can emerge from these decisions.  Examples of internal issues including the transition from the founder-entrepreneur to a professionally run firm, as well as strategic change, are examined."
MGMT312,Asia Pacific Business," In the past decade, the United States  economy grew by an average of 1.6% a year, the European Union s by 1.7%, Latin America s by 4.6%, East Asia's by 5.4% and South-East Asia's by 5.9%. The 21 economies of the largest trans-Pacific grouping, Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC), account for nearly half of global trade. The region comprises not only the world s  factory floor  but also its most important sources of services, technology and investments, and final goods markets,  writes Peter Petri, an international trade economist.   Yet despite the much celebrated economic progress of the region and the potential to be reaped from it, there are clear strains and risks resulting from geopolitical and economic trends which impact businesses that operate here.

This course consists of a set of core lectures which will introduce students to: (a) economic, political and socio-cultural theories and frameworks for understanding the context of business in the Asia Pacific region; and (b) the application of international business theories and frameworks to understand the decision-making processes of companies investing in the region. Course participants are expected to apply theories and frameworks to assess business environments of specific Asian economies.  Participants are expected to analyse and make presentations about issues and challenges that are relevant to companies operating in large emerging economies such as China, India, Taiwan, and South Korea but also other economies such as Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam."
MGMT315,Global Mega-Trends,"Megatrends describe data within macro-perspectives spanning over 5-30 years that may have profound implications on values, strategies and risk review. Cause & effect relations are often unknown, occur in small doses and are interdependent. Thus, consequences are not immediately evident. This course helps students to understand the importance and developments of globally evolving data patterns in 5 key domains: ecology, society, economy, geo-political and technology.

Opportunities, complexities and uncertainties are discussed in a business context. We will contrast findings, practices and lessons learnt when analyzing the effects of resource scarcity, environmental and societal stress, demographic change, diversity, globalization and the economic system. Further, we will explore developments in key technology areas (artificial intelligence, big data, biotech, nanotech, ITC, internet security and space technology) and debate implications on Singapore s transition into a knowledge- and innovation-based economy. Special topics on  Closed & Finite System Thinking ,  Non-linear Behavior ,  Culture  and  Risk Mitigation  complement the course. Trends are internalized through examples and a research project to ascertain a solid understanding of ongoing debates. Interest in the discussion of current world affairs and a passion for creating a better future are pre-requisites to succeed."
MGMT318,Design Thinking and Innovation,"Design Thinking is a human-centric, interdisciplinary approach towards innovation that aims to help companies and startups change and innovate. This course introduces Design Thinking (similar to the IDEO approach   www.ideo.com) and its application to developing new  things  (i.e. products, services, experiences and business models). The course is divided into four main aspects, all interconnected but separately emphasized: (1) design methodologies (e.g. ethnographic research, brainstorming, prototyping), (2) the  thing  to be designed (3) attitudes and behaviors and (4) design contexts. Design contexts refer to the broader emerging context for designs and business, specifically, society (including different cultures and the poor), and the physical environment. Learning will be primarily experiential in nature   through class discussion, group exercises, and a team project. Guest speakers with practical experience in Design Thinking may be invited as well."
MGMT319,Management of Technology and Innovation,"For their long-term survival, all organisations need to innovate their product and/or service portfolios, as well as how they organise their processes. Innovation is often a continuous process. Sometimes organisations have a breakthrough product, but more often innovation is a continuous sequence of smaller improvements, recombining existing technologies into a new approach, and re-positioning existing solutions into new business models - all to enhance the value proposition for the customer in a significant way.
Innovation and product development require creativity and imagination, but also hard work in the form of project management under uncertainty, improving the productivity of R&D, finding the best way to organise for speed and quality of the development cycle, profit management, etc. Being an innovator requires talent.
This course will not transform you into an innovator, but will help you hone your skills in managing the product development and innovation process. This course will familiarise you with how organisations manage the process of innovation and how they develop successful products, services and systems. The focus will be on innovation and product development in existing organisations. While we may touch on the topic of corporate entrepreneurship, this course is not about the start-up of new companies, nor is it a course on marketing of new products. The course is most valuable for those who want to work in industrial firms or do consulting work.

Please take note of the timings for the site visits and guest seminars indicated in the course outline."
MGMT322,International Corporate Governance and Strategy,"Corporate governance is about the relationship between the managers/executives of a firm and its various stakeholders including shareholders, employees, and larger community. Different countries have different systems of capitalism and deal with this relationship in very different ways.  Because of these differences, specific systems and practices of corporate governance differ greatly around the world and in Asia. These differences, however, have been under pressure, as capital, management, and business practices become more global. Indeed, many Asian countries have revised their corporate governance system that is more consistent with global rules and expectations of investors who invest globally.  

This course aims to make participants aware of the key issues that are related to corporate governance in especially the Asian context by examining corporate governance practices in various Asian countries and comparing them with non-Asian models, specifically the US and Germany.  Participants will be equipped with the conceptual frameworks and tools to understand and analyze the issues that are pertinent to corporate governance practices as well as their impacts on other issues such as firm performance, business ethics, and firm strategy."
MGMT325,Entrepreneurship Study Mission (Asian Studies),"The course focuses on entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial activities in one or more cities/countries in Asia so as to appreciate the business/entrepreneurial environment as well as the socio-cultural aspects of the society being visited. The course typically involves classes on campus in Singapore prior to a short but intensive overseas trip. Visits made to companies, NPOs, government agencies, and/or universities are a key component of this course"
MGMT326,Entrepreneurship Study Mission (Globalisation),"The course focuses on entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial activities in one or more cities/countries beyond Asia so as to appreciate the business/entrepreneurial environment as well as the socio-cultural aspects of the society being visited. The course typically involves classes on campus in Singapore prior to a short but intensive overseas trip. Visits made to companies, NPOs, government agencies, and/or universities are a key component of this course"
MGMT327,Entrepreneurship Practicum,"At the core of the course is the process of developing low-cost, quick consumer experiments, mostly simultaneously, to learn about the market potential for different variants of new products or services, which will be iterated multiple times until an attractive variant of the new business idea is identified or an avenue to an adjacent space is explored. The course also familiarizes students with how best to present their market validation information and the initial outlines of their business and revenue models on social platforms and to early-stage investors.

The course will guide students in the process of developing and market-testing new venture ideas. Students will work in teams, and each team will receive a grant of $700 towards prototyping and market testing their new venture idea. Also, mentors will give the team feedback on their market testing process.

Student teams (3 tor 5 students per team) can be preformed before the course or can be formed in the first three weeks of the course. If you have an idea but lack team members, or you lack an idea but would like to join a team visit this web page https://smu.sg/1lq to post your ideas and seek team members or views ideas and to join originators of ideas as team members. If you are interested in the course and want to find team members please send an email to adamequek@smu.edu.sg with the header  Entrepreneurship Practicum .

The student team business idea should be scalable, i.e., the aspiration of the student team should be to have at least 10 employees or $1 million in revenue within five years. If the business is a social entrepreneurship, a similar metric for social impact as appropriate will be encouraged.  Student teams, as pre-formed, will remain the same for the duration of the course. Any disagreements within a team will have to be resolved by the team members themselves.

This course is not for students with more mature businesses; students who already have a business with finished products and/or services and with customers are encouraged to approach SMU-IIE for entry into the incubation program."
MGMT330,The Design of Business,"The Capstone course allows students to apply a cross-disciplinary approach while considering both business model architecture and the formulation of business solutions. It prepares students for the complex business environment of today by emphasising the application of academic knowledge accumulated from a range of prior core courses to solving real world problems. The course develops in students an ability to: strategically position the client and its challenge within an environmental context; appropriately scope the challenge of the client; develop and execute a workplan to address the challenge; and develop solutions by establishing a fact-base through directed primary and secondary research, drawing out relevant insights through analytic review, and engaging in abstract idea generation. The course exposes students to the uncertainties and ambiguity that exists within real-world business landscapes and organisational environments of industry clients, as well as, the challenges with engaging busy business executives and convincing them and their organisation of innovative solutions that have been devised by the students that address the client s real-world challenges."
MGMT331,Management of Multinationals Across Asia,"The greatest percentage of Singaporean graduates will seek jobs in a multinational so it is important they understand the operating environment they would work within. For those graduates who choose a start-up or SME, there is also a government initiative to encourage more Singaporean firms to establish operations overseas so it is important to understand the challenges and process of doing so. Accordingly, this Capstone course integrates content drawn from practice and research on establishing a business overseas and managing a multinational, as well as, an X-Culture SMU-X experiential exercise with a real company so the student:

1. Understands the topology of differences (cognitive, cultural, nation state, institutional, business systems, market economies, economic maturity, and geographic) that exists, particularly, among countries in Asia, and must be accommodated within an internationalised business model as SMEs/MNCs establish operations outside their home country.

2. Builds upon their prior courses, particularly business strategy, to understand the process of formulating and operationalising a strategy to internationalise towards foreign markets, as well as, the considerations and trade-offs when executing those steps. This will include an understanding of the roles and management interactions of locals versus expatriates, as well as, among host country subsidiaries, regional offices, and corporate headquarters. Emphasis is applied to understanding the strategic advantages possessed by a multinational; their ability to transfer such advantages from its home to host markets; as well as, the capacity of corporate headquarters to absorb new knowledge from its foreign operations in order to sustain and enhance its engagement within Asia.

3. Experiences what it is like to work in a MNC by applying a cross-disciplinary approach as a member of a global cross-cultural team. After all, reading a textbook does not allow a true appreciation of the reality of international cross-cultural business collaboration   one must experience it! You will apply both the course content and your accumulated academic knowledge at SMU in providing recommendations to a real-life SME as to a new market entry strategy (or similar assignment) encompassing market selection, entry method, marketing and operational considerations. As a participant in this global X-Culture initiative the SMU student will work in teams drawn among 5,000 students from 150 participating universities within 40 countries around the globe. After the successful completion of the exercise, in addition to the normal SMU grade, students will receive a X-Culture certificate, a performance report, and a recommendation letter reflecting your performance. The best teams will also be invited to the X-Culture Global Symposium held in July each year.

Consistent with SMU s experiential and formative teaching pedagogy, there will be three short quizzes throughout the term to promote greater knowledge retention (there is no final exam). In addition, you will choose your own local SMU teams to participate in the  Great SMU Debate  and a case study prior to embarking on the X-Culture experiential exercise with your global teams during the second part of the course."
MGMT334,Sustainable Entrepreneurship Practicum,"Sustainable Entrepreneurship involves the application of business solutions to societal problems. It entails new ways of creating, capturing, and delivering sustainable impact in a commercially viable way.

At the core of the course is the process of developing low-cost experiments to learn about the viability of new processes, products, or services that create, capture, or deliver sustainable impact. There will be multiple iterations of the idea until an attractive variant is identified or an avenue to an adjacent space is explored. The course also familiarizes students with how best to present their market validation information and the initial outlines of their business models or cost-benefit analysis to stakeholders including internal corporate champions or external early-stage investors in the social impact space.

The course will guide students in the process of developing and validating new ideas to create sustainable impact either through a new venture or with a company. Students will work in teams, and each team will be assigned to a mentor who will provide the team with feedback over the course of the project.

Students can enroll in the practicum either as a team to work on their own idea for a new venture idea, or they may enroll individually and be assigned to join a team working with entrepreneurial companies on new initiatives. These initiatives with companies will be pre-selected by the instructor before class."
MGMT337,Sustainability Study Mission (Asian Studies),"This course focuses on the theme of sustainability and sustainable business practices in one or more cities/ countries in Asia. It gives students a good understanding not just of how sustainability is practised in these places, but also the economic, political, social and cultural context that give rise to these practices. The course typically begins with a series of classes on campus and culminates in a short but intensive overseas trip. While overseas, visits are made to companies, NPOs, government agencies, and/or universities."
MGMT338,Sustainability Study Mission (Globalisation),"This course focuses on the theme of sustainability and sustainable business practices in one or more cities/ countries beyond Asia. It gives students a good understanding not just of how sustainability is practised in these places, but also the economic, political, social and cultural context that give rise to these practices. The course typically begins with a series of classes on campus and culminates in a short but intensive overseas trip. While overseas, visits are made to companies, NPOs, government agencies, and/or universities."
MGMT339,The Innovation and Entrepreneurship Ecosystem in China,"This course aims to equip students with skills to understand and analyze the Innovation and Entrepreneurship ecosystem in China. This is done through a systematic review and analysis of the research on Innovation and Entrepreneurship. A good understanding of the relevant research will better prepare students to both leverage on the Innovation and Entrepreneurship ecosystem to find talent, ideas, and entrepreneurial ventures, and to better lead innovative initiatives as managers or leaders.

To facilitate the experiential learning process, students will work on an Innovation Challenge proposed by a corporate sponsor. Selected business leaders will be invited to share their insights and their entrepreneurial experience with students."
MGMT344,Scaling Start-ups and Social Ventures Through Governance,"This course equips aspiring entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurs, and managers with essential tools for scaling and retaining impact through governance. It delves through recent governance debacles and explores what investors look for in how start-ups deal with and mitigate risks. Such an approach applies equally to social enterprises because although causes make great narratives on entrepreneurship, they do not necessarily create sustained impact, not without enforcing key tenets of governance & sustainability. Separately, understanding the role of high-growth ventures and socially-oriented ventures in society enables each venture to contribute more successfully. It focuses the student entrepreneur on the strategic need to balance innovation with governance and sustainability in building a resilient enterprise."
MGMT004,Creative Thinking,"This course is designed to enhance your understanding of the concepts of creative thinking and to inspire and influence you with new ways of looking at problems and resolving them. The content will include both historic and contemporary examples of innovative companies and highly creative individuals who are leaders in creative endeavours and enterprises in various fields such as the visual arts, science, architecture, philosophy, IT, advertising, animation and consumer products.
You will also be given opportunities to discover and express your imagination in various areas of creativity and engage in meaningful creative activities individually as well as in teams. You will find that working together in teams with members from different disciplines and with different talents will enhance your individual creativity."
MGMT102,Strategy,"This course introduces students to the theoretical concepts and analytical tools required for formulating and implementing appropriate strategies that affect the enduring success of the entire organization. Topics covered include external and internal environmental analyses, business-level strategies, corporate-level strategies, competitive dynamics, and special topics such as global strategy. This course emphasizes the application of theory to the real world strategic issues. Students are encouraged to synthesize knowledge from other business courses into a comprehensive understanding of competitive advantage."
MGMT105,"Current Issues in Business, Culture, and Society","The ability to work and live respectfully in an ideologically and culturally diverse environment is a crucial 21st century survival skill.   And as businesses explore opportunities in other countries, they will be challenged to adapt to new markets  local characteristics, financial policies, sociopolitical environments, and cultural systems.   Developing the managerial skills you will need to excel in a multi-cultural global business environment is what MGMT 105 is all about. 

Each week you will attend the Wee Kim Wee Lunchtime Talks and/or the Wee Kim Wee Conversations with Ambassadors.  You ll hear insider stories as well as be exposed to different value systems and new ways of thinking.  Through these talks you ll gain insights for building the skills, sensitivity, and cultural awareness you ll need to be managerially effective in whatever context you find yourself.

You ll also be writing reflection papers based on the talks.  These will be evaluated for their readability, quality and vibrancy in terms of what you are learning as well as your writing skill.  You ll be challenged to develop and sharpen your writing skills and idea formation so that you ll be better prepared for communicating in a variety of managerial contexts."
MGMT106,Introduction to Organisations,This course helps students understand challenges facing organizations and how elements of organization design relate to these challenges. This is done through a systematic review and analysis of the research on organization theory and design. Familiarity with this research and the insights it offers will better prepare students to both operate effectively in various types of organizations as members and better direct and guide these organizations as managers or leaders.
MGMT107,Airline Strategy,"This course introduces students to the theoretical concepts, analytical tools and real-life situations of airlines in Asia and elsewhere in the world.  Topics covered include economics, regulation, technology choices, industry trends and different forms of inter-firm competition, at selected points in time and geography, including examples in North America, Europe and Asia.  This course emphasizes the application of theory to the real world strategic issues in primarily the scheduled passenger airline industry."
MGMT108,Introduction to Business Analytics,"Technology enhancement has enabled the business world to produce and store very large amounts of data which needs to be processed, managed and analyzed to uncover its hidden value. These values have shown to be an asset to businesses, given its potential to improve the future performance. Companies that want to tap into this potential have to turn to Business Analytics, which helps to gain insights from data that improves business decisions.

This course aims to introduce students to the fundamental skills of Analytics. Using Excel as the main software, this course helps students build a foundation needed for advanced analytics by introducing them to data exploration techniques, preparing the data for analysis, understanding how to formulate and identify the correct analytical approach to solve the business problem. This course also introduces the use of analytics in related business problems from the areas of Finance, Marketing and Operations."
MGMT207,Leadership and Organisations,"The course is designed to expose students to multiple and diverse perspectives of leadership.  It will analyse leadership not only in the business world but also in politics and the arts.   It will examine, in particular, how leadership is exercised in different types of organisations and portrayed in different media including films, plays and novels.  The focus of the course will not be on the identification of critical leadership traits or tasks but on the interactions between a leader, the organisation and context in which leadership emerges.  A series of CEO talks will be organised as part of the course."
MGMT214,Management and Leadership: A Seminar with CEOs,This course is designed to give students opportunities to listen to and interact with about 12 CEOs/MDs each semester.  The invited speakers will share with students their views on leadership and management.
MGMT215,Work and Family,"This course focuses on a dilemma most workers today face: how to balance work roles (employee and manager) and other life roles, especially family member roles. Problems juggling multiple roles (often termed work-nonwork/ family conflict) result in negative outcomes for individuals (e.g., poor health) and organizations (e.g., turnover of star employees). However, engaging in multiple roles also has benefits for individuals and organizations. Drawing especially on current academic research and global organizational practices, students are provided with a broad overview of related topics by exposing them to a variety of theories, concepts, findings, and unresolved issues within this area. Multiple activities will help students identify individual preferences for roles, gain skills to better balance of roles, and create a modifiable, goal-directed framework related to their current and future selves."
MGMT216,Social Intelligence for Enhancing Interpersonal Skills,"Social Intelligence is an important element of human development. Unlike hair colour and height, interpersonal skills are to a large extent learnt. By the same token, social intelligence can be learnt, and with practice, enhances our interpersonal skills. In this module, social intelligence refers to interpersonal intelligence, emotional intelligence, successful intelligence and moral intelligence. The theoretical foundations of each perspective and its application in the real world will be examined."
MGMT218S,Entrepreneurship in Asia,"Embedded at a key entrepreneurial hub of Asia young and fast-growing economic region, this course in SMU traces the steps that entrepreneurs likely encounter from a first recognition of a potential business opportunity to the nascent operation of the actual company. This course teaches students the basic ingredients of a business plan and a short  pitch  for their ideas.
Customized through the exposure to start-up communities in Asia and the use of relevant business cases, all underpinned by rigorous problem-based learning, this course helps students address various start-up issues and become more familiar with nuances of starting up in Asia."
MGMT222S,Asian Family Businesses,"Family businesses are the most prevalent form of business in the world, especially in Asia. It is also an emerging and vibrant area of interest among academics, practitioners and students of management. This course explores the unique challenges and opportunities involves in leadership and management of Asian family businesses. Key family, ownership, leadership and management issues relevant to the management and continuity of these enterprises will be covered. Topics in this course include the uniqueness of family business, succession, governance, working with non-family managers, leadership, and entrepreneurship in family businesses. It will also cover a topic overlooked by most family business courses   the dark side of Asian family businesses.
This course will be useful to students from business-owning families. As most of the business organizations in Asia, such as China, India, Korea Japan, Taiwan and the Asean countries are family-owned, this course will also benefit students who may work for a family business in the course of their future careers. Students who wish to enter the private banking, wealth management, corporate banking and consulting industry will find knowledge gained in this course helpful to their work. Anyone who thinks the interaction of two somewhat mutually exclusive systems   the family and the business - difficult will find this course fascinating."
MGMT223S,Social Entrepreneurship in Asia,"Social entrepreneurship is an area of importance globally as communities, institutions, and individuals seek to find new ways to address social needs that are not met by, or inadequately provided for, by government and society. In this course, you will learn concepts, frameworks, and practical skills to strategize, organize, and act to address social needs through sustainable business ventures. This course is designed for students who are primarily interested in organizing to create local, regional, or international impact by addressing environmental and social issues - such as poverty, inequality, hunger, exploitation, social mobility, and educational access - through business with a particular focus on Singapore and South-East Asia."
MGMT225S,Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Asia,"Interested in making a true impact in society? The harsh reality of the mainstay of a large array of social problems in Asia such as persistent poverty, income inequality, non-inclusive economic development, ethnic and religious conflicts, and environmental hazards among others, has led to an increased interest in how social innovators can utilize entrepreneurship as potential solutions to these problems. Social entrepreneurship has gained prominence as a field that drives social change in areas where the traditional philanthropic model has become overwhelmed in achieving sustainable change. The course will serve as an introduction to the social enterprise ecosystem in Asia, how it operates, its challenges and success stories. Through critical analysis of case studies from across the continent, best practices will be identified. Out of classroom sessions and site visits will help the theoretical concepts come alive in the real world. Additionally, in line with the practical focus of this course, students will get opportunities to engage in systems thinking in defining problems, business model presentations, developing funding strategies and evaluating social impact, during classroom activity sessions. This course will focus on some key steps in envisioning a social enterprise and how these can be applied to develop a scalable social business idea."
MGMT226,Facilitation and Counselling Skills,"Facilitation and counseling skills are essential life-skills for career success.  At SMU, we have started the Peer Helping Program in 2003. One of the goals of this program is to empower students to help one-another in peer-settings.  Feedback about the program has been positive. However, there is an expressed need for more training on facilitation and counseling skills to enhance the effectiveness of peer helpers and students involved in various social work organizations.

This course is for students who desire to be involved in the Peer Helping Program and those seeking to enhance their helping skills. It aims to equip students with key facilitation and counseling skills that will be immediately useful for peer helping. The competencies acquired in this course will also be relevant in preparing students for work-life in future. Topics covered include, facilitation techniques and processes, active listening, attending skills, empathy skills, self-care, etc. The hands-on exercises of the course will be enriching and insightful in terms of personal development and growth. Students will also be exposed to a broad range of life issues beyond the confine of the class-room."
MGMT227,Managing Creativity in Organizations,"While business leaders agree that creativity and innovation is key to corporate and entrepreneurial successes, there is little consensus on how to foster, sustain, and harness individual and team creativity in corporations. This course provides a survey of theories, research and practitioner insights into this issue of fostering and harnessing corporate creativity. Topics include: approaches to creativity, the creative individual, creative thinking processes, creativity techniques and programs, total systems approach, and case studies of creative organizations."
MGMT228,Learning From Experience,"Research in organizations and in learning show that experience is the greatest teacher.  Lectures and formal training provide information and can build conceptual capabilities.  However, the best learning occurs through experiences   it is what we do when faced with new information, problems or situations. This course is designed to build participant knowledge and skills to excel at learning from experience. A basic premise of this course if that because the problems faced by professionals and managers today (and in the future) are increasingly complex, their success will depend on their ability to learn quickly from each experience, to integrate different learning approaches to maximize learning, and to translate that learning into practical solutions for related problem sets. This course provides participants with conceptual frameworks and practical skills that will benefit them throughout their career.

Specific learning objectives are as follows:
 To gain broad understanding of the central concepts in learning from experience, and to improve ability to analyze developmental opportunities a situation affords.
 To better understand and improve your ability to utilize a range of learning tactics such that you extract greater learning from key experience.
 To understand and be able to utilize methods that facilitate group learning.
 To understand why these concepts are important for business and how they can be applied throughout ones  career"
MGMT232,Business Consulting,"The course  Business Consulting  is jointly offered by SMU and the University of St.Gallen. It is a unique opportunity for students to learn more about consulting services. The course is a combination of classic in-class teaching and active interaction with the business world via project work and guest lecturers. Students will apply their theoretical knowledge to a real business project and work together in a team with fellow students on a real consulting project for an international corporation. The lecture will introduce you to the world of consulting by teaching you the basic steps of a consulting process. You will learn how consultants frame, analyse and solve problems and how they present their solutions to the clients.

In addition, there will be guest speakers who work/ have worked with major consultancy companies such as McKinsey. They will provide you with industry insights and hands-on experiences about the day-to-day business of a consultant. In class, we will review basic theoretical frameworks in order to reduce complexity and structure a complex situation/project. Several case situations will help you to develop an understanding of how to approach a business project.

Furthermore, the course offers students the chance to explore and apply competencies learned through a real life, multidisciplinary, team-based consulting experience with a multinational company/organization. You will be working in teams for large corporations, acting as consultants working on specific problem sets. The solutions you develop will be presented to the senior management of the companies. In previous semesters, companies included Nestl  (nutrition), Lufthansa (airline), Far East Organization (real estate), Bosch Siemens (household appliances), etc. Please note that all consulting project are real business projects with renowned corporations, which have great interest in the solutions prepared by the students."
MGMT237,Corporate Strategy,"This builds on the course 'Strategy'.  Corporate strategy is the pattern of decision-making that determines a firm s goals and objectives, produces principal policies, defines the range of business to pursue, and pertains to the overall plan for a diversified firm.  A firm s corporate strategy acts as both a catalyst for and a constraint on the strategies of its business units.  If the business strategies do not support the firm s corporate strategy, synergy becomes impossible.  Therefore, this progression reinforces the inextricable link between business strategy and corporate strategy, with cases of business integration, strategic alliances, corporate diversification, and mergers and acquisitions.  Drawing on these factors, the major objective of this course is to help student to understand: 1) conditions under which different types of corporate strategy have the potential to create (economic and social) value, competitive and corporate advantages; and 2) organizational and managerial systems that must be in place in order to realize this potential value creation."
MGMT238,Strategic Leadership in Business,"Strategic leadership of a firm has shown to make a significant impact on business performance, yet this is an often overlooked area by business leaders today. As we look to understand why organizations do the things that they do, we need to understand the people at the top. It is their experiences, abilities, values, connections, and other dynamics that influence their strategic choices that guide the direction of the firm. We will examine individual leaders (What can we learn in contrasting the leadership of Apple vs. Samsung?), leadership teams (What composition of a top management team works best when comparing companies such as Petronas and BP?), and board composition (What can we learn from the governance structures of Yahoo! and Google?). Whether it is a Fortune 100 company or a small start-up, the individual executives, top management teams, and the governing bodies (board of directors) make an impact on the outcomes of the firm. This is not only critical for future business leaders, but also an important lens for future financial analysts and investors."
MGMT242,Corporate Sustainable Product and System Design,"Companies increasingly seek to be more sustainable, but many firms struggle to operationalize the concepts within their organizations and supply chain, or to translate theoretical concepts into practical value for themselves and their customers. Sustainability practitioners must not only help develop (i.e., design) and sell a sustainable product or service, but an entire mind-set, and where necessary, to devise changes in business models and operations. The course will guide students, working in teams, through a development process involving market and strategic assessment, positioning of the product (including its sustainability attributes), customer-centric design, and business model innovation. This will in turn lead students to develop value propositions and marketing, which will be presented in a final pitch session to the client s representatives. The primary methodology will consist of design thinking techniques, which will be broadly used and adapted to the sustainability context. Phases of design include the understanding of candidate consumers  (users ) needs by qualitative means, creation of basic product concepts and prototypes, and the testing and validation of prototypes with users. Implications will also be drawn for the client s business model. Note that the course may be more time-intensive than a content-based or normal SMU-X course, as it centers on a project with a methodology (design thinking), but also involves content on sustainability and business, and involves some use of analytical techniques such as secondary market research (e.g. assembling of data on consumer segment numbers). Note that the data and analysis may change depending on the client involved. As an example, a past class client was a multinational nutritional supplements company interested in servicing Asian markets with a sustainability value proposition. Future clients will be different firms."
MGMT245,Overseas Project Experience (Digital Business Transformation across Asia Practicum),"Amidst the accelerated drive towards digital transformation catalysed by the Covid-19 pandemic, a recent HBR report revealed a daunting 87.5% average digital transformation failure rate.  This high failure rate could have been attributed to factors like inability to navigate the digital transformation initiatives through uncertainties and continuously reinvent themselves. Consequently, business leaders are fervently seeking new avenues for growth, be it through market expansion or a profound recalibration of their digital business strategies.

This course will allow students to focus on the role of digital marketing, combined with other digital tools to help Southeast Asia businesses to transform their marketing & business strategies and design & test digital business strategies to improve their competitiveness and business performances in the digital age. It hones students  problem-solving skills and prepares them for the complex regional business environment today.

Let s set our sights on Vietnam, a key economic contributor to the ASEAN region. In 2022, Vietnam's GDP was ranked second in ASEAN, after Indonesia. Vietnam's prime industries include manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism. Vietnam has a number of growth opportunities in the coming years. These include:
- Continued growth in the manufacturing industry, driven by demand from the United States and Europe.
- Expansion of the agricultural industry, driven by rising demand for food in Asia.
- Growth of the tourism industry, driven by the country's natural beauty and cultural attractions.
- Development of the services sector, such as finance, insurance, and telecommunications.
- Vietnam is well-positioned to take advantage of these growth opportunities and become a leading economy in the ASEAN region.

In addition to the industries mentioned above, Vietnam also has a growing IT and digital economy. The country is home to a number of start-ups and tech companies, and is attracting investment from foreign companies. Vietnam is also a major producer of renewable energy, and is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing demand for clean energy in the region.

Overall, Vietnam is a dynamic and growing economy with a bright future. The country has a young and growing population, a low cost of labour, and a favourable business environment. Vietnam is well-positioned to become a major economic power in the coming years."
MGMT246,Strategic Risks and Opportunities Management,"In the current business landscape, companies face a multitude of risks and opportunities, driven by the dynamic and uncertain global environment. Significant challenges faced by firms across industries is the rapid advancement of digital technologies, the emergence of Industry 4.0 and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. To achieve superior performance and sustainable competitive advantage, organizations must proactively recognize and address these factors.

Digital transformation of industries not only reshapes the business landscape but also introduces new risks and opportunities, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity. Protecting sensitive data and information from cyber threats becomes paramount in this context. Simultaneously, organizations must develop managerial capabilities to effectively navigate the changing digital landscape and mitigate these risks. While this poses significant challenges that demand attention, it also presents opportunities for companies to capture.

The course aims to address these challenges comprehensively. It will explore how companies can effectively manage strategic change to configure their businesses for competitive advantages. Participants will gain insights into digital concepts and technologies such as omni-channels, platforms, eco-systems, blockchain, IoT, AI, and cloud computing, understanding their potential benefits and the associated risks. They will also learn tools and techniques to managing strategic risks and leveraging opportunities.

By focusing on the risks and opportunities associated with strategic change, digital transformation, cybersecurity, etc. in the contemporary business environment, this course equips students with the necessary knowledge and skills to navigate these challenges effectively. Through informed decision-making and proactive measures, organizations can harness these factors to achieve sustainable competitive advantage while also fulfilling their responsibilities to stakeholders and the broader society."
MGMT301,Business Study Mission (Asian Studies),"The course incorporates a planned visit to one or more cities/countries in Asia, so that students may get a better appreciation of the business  and socio-cultural environment of the cities/countries studied. The course typically begins with a series of classes on campus and culminates in a short but intensive overseas trip. While overseas, visits are made to companies, NPOs, government agencies, and/or universities."
MGMT315S,Global Megatrends: Opportunities and Challenges in Asia,"Megatrends describe data sets that provide us with macro-perspectives spanning over 5-30 years that may have profound implications on business values as well as for scenario or strategic planning processes. Although cause & effect relations are typically ambiguous and interdependent, they offer useful insights for the external and internal strategic analysis that often lead to revised business models, disruptive innovations and differentiated market positions.
This course helps students to understand the developments of globally evolving data patterns in 5 key domains: Ecology, Society, Economy, Geopolitics and Technology. Their implications will be discussed in an Asian context. We will contrast findings, practices and lessons learnt for future Managers operating in Asia when analyzing the effects of e.g. resource scarcity, societal stress, demographic change, migration, globalization as well as the economic system. A particular focus will be assigned to the rise of China and its geo-political implications on its Asian neighbours. Further, we will explore developments in key technology areas (e.g. artificial intelligence, biotech, nanotech, cyber security and space exploration).
In particular, we will debate implications on Singapore s transition into a knowledge-, innovation- and service based economy as an example to contrast initiatives in other Asian Megacities, such as Shanghai, Jakarta or Mumbai. Special topics on  Asian Cultures ,  Finite System Thinking ,  Non-linear Behaviour ,  Risk Mitigation  and  Venture Capital in Asia  complement the course. Trends are internalized through examples and an Asia-related, desktop-based research project to ascertain a solid understanding of ongoing debates. An appreciation of the emergence of Asia, a general interest in current world affairs and a passion to create a better future are pre-requisites to succeed in this course."
MGMT317,Managing Process Improvement,"All firms have processes, most of which can be improved or optimized.  Some of these processes include innovation, development, manufacturing, services, internal and external processes.  The ability of managers to define, measure, improve and control processes is a key skill set and, combined with leadership, can enhance the success of a firm. 

In this course, students will develop a combination of practical tool knowledge and project management skills to effectively change and improve important processes.  Students will also gain a strong theoretical and practical understanding of six sigma deployment and will have the opportunity to achieve SMU Six Sigma  Greenbelt  certification.  Students will learn the DMAIC methodology (Design, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) and apply it in real projects.  These projects will be sponsored by SMU, local SME s and MNC s.

This course will also allow students to further develop and get feedback on the following SMU Graduate Learning Outcomes: disciplinary knowledge, critical thinking and problem solving, collaboration and leadership, communication, self-directed learning, and resilience. (See https://www.smu.edu.sg/programmes/graduate-learning-outcomes)"
MGMT321,Business Study Mission (Globalisation),"The course incorporates a planned visit to one or more cities/countries beyond the region, so that students may get a better appreciation of the business  and socio-cultural environment of the cities/countries studied. The course typically begins with a series of classes on campus and culminates in a short but intensive overseas trip. While overseas, visits are made to companies, NPOs, government agencies, and/or universities."
MGMT323,"Sustainable Growth in ASEAN: Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia","At the end of 1945, the areas bordering the Straits of Malacca were facing recovery from wartime destruction and the sharp decline of colonial rule.  Indonesia, the largest and most geographically widespread, in 1945 was the first to become independent.  Formed in 1948, the Federation of Malaya became independent in 1957.  The city state of Singapore broke off from Malaya and became independent in 1965.  At this point, these three post-colonial countries were at somewhat similar levels of development (although the British had treated Singapore as an urban center and a major port -- not an agricultural resource).  All three were low income countries with per capita GDP ranging from $56 in Indonesia, $333 in Malaysia to $516 in Singapore.  Indonesia and Malaysia possessed significant natural resources, whereas Singapore (now cut off from Malaysia) was bereft even of water.  Over the past fifty years, the political and economic choices made in the three countries have varied, and their growth trajectories diverged.  Today, per capita GDP varies greatly:  Indonesia, $3,491; Malaysia, $11,307; and Singapore, $56,284 (World Bank data).

These three countries have pursued different pathways which to some extent can be explained by economic drivers, but also by government policy choices with regard to inclusive growth.  The course will consider this in the context of business in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, and will study it from multiple perspectives:  government, corporate/family business, and social impact. To examine this in a one-week timeframe, we will focus on the development of infrastructure, real estate (housing), education and health care.

Resource-rich environments attract investors, but managing today in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia where governments are sensitive to issues of competitive and strategic sustainability, raises challenges.  Having moved from low income status to low middle-middle income status, Indonesia and Malaysia face the challenge of avoiding the  middle-income trap,  the situation where developing economies  convergence to the development frontier comes to a halt once their income per capita reaches a middle-income level.  In contrast, Singapore surmounted that challenged, but now as an advanced market economy, it faces the challenge of a small, high wage country (5.5 million): the need to innovate to remain competitive at this level."
MGMT332,Approaching Asian Business through Classics,"The course focuses on world-changing ideas that have shaped the business world and the thinking of people in East and Southeast Asia.  It analyzes the relevance and impact of selected readings in history and philosophy on economic, social and cultural changes in East and Southeast Asia.  It will examine issues including state and corporate governance, work and organizations, gender, inequality and religious beliefs, and evaluate the trade-offs Asian societies make between individual liberty, national progress, regional imperatives and global capitalism."
MGMT333,Belt and Road Initiative (China),"This new elective is designed to help students develop an in-depth understanding and analysis of strategic business opportunities in ASEAN relating to China s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It will introduce key concepts in strategic management and involve students in a real-life strategic business challenge proposed by PIL Logistics.

Under the third Sino-Singapore flagship project, Singapore and China are collaborating on the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative - New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor (CCI- ILSTC) as part of the BRI partnership. The CCI-ILSTC links the Belt (the overland Silk Road Economic Belt) and the Road (the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road) via rail and sea, which makes Singapore a key node on the BRI. CCI-ILSTC will reduce the time taken for goods travelling from Singapore to Chongqing from four weeks to about a week.

This elective will feature a visit to Lanzhou & Dunhuang to understand the agricultural produce in Gansu Province, and to have a comprehensive understanding of the broader CCI-ILSTC project which is potentially a new high-growth opportunity for Singaporeans. Participants will have the opportunity to engage business leaders, entrepreneurs and government officials in project discussions."
MGMT340,Understanding Chinese Culture and Business Environment,"The SIE6011A-MGMT340 Understanding Chinese Culture and Business Environment program comprises some of the most economically significant Chinese cities located in the southern parts of China. This program is designed to develop students  appreciation of the nuances of China s business practices in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and the Shantou Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in South China. It explores the various unique aspects of China s history, culture, society, value system, business practices, and its implication to doing business in this tectonic economy.

The course seeks to understand the knowledge and behaviours necessary to successfully meander through China s business environment, encouraging the student to take a truly local perspective in dealing with dynamic management issues in this diverse eco-system. It emphasizes how the variables of politico-socio-cultural practices interact with other national and international factors to affect managerial processes and behaviours, and illustrates current developments and trends. In addition, the growing competitive influence of e-commerce will also be considered. The highlight of the course is its emphasis on experiential education   interaction with government representatives and senior business practitioners.

The scope of the coursework includes assessing China s unique business eco-system (political, economic, legal), appreciating China s leadership, understanding various aspects of doing business in China, learning Chinese etiquette, fostering successful relationships (the importance and the art of relationships), and getting a glimpse of China s economic future development.

Throughout the course, the students are expected to apply what they have learned in the course and assess the relevance of these factors in doing business in China."
MGMT342,Organisational Aspects of Sustainable Innovation,"This course initiative rests on the assumption that there is a powerful synergy between  sustainability  and  innovation  in business and society. The term  sustainable innovation  refers to the creation of new market space, products and services or processes driven by social, environmental or sustainability concerns. Just like general innovation, sustainable innovation goes way beyond incremental improvements of products, services or processes. The challenge is to proactively embrace risk management and sustainability considerations (environmental, social, financial) aimed at aligning (novel) business strategies with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to create and capture new value. If managed well by results-oriented, socially aware sustainability leaders, sustainable innovation results not only in greater effectiveness at (intra)organisational levels but also helps to create a cleaner, healthier, fairer (and hopefully more stable) world as envisaged by the circular economy. The urgent need for sustainability has never been greater as evidenced by rapid population growth, pollution, (toxic) waste, plastic accumulating in our oceans, limited natural resources, climate change etc. This course will introduce students to the managerial discipline of innovation management with particular reference to examples of  good  /  best  sustainable innovation practices adopted by both local and international organisations such as City Development Limited (CDL), Banyan Tree, Sustainability Center Freiburg (launched in 2015 by the University of Freiburg in cooperation with five Fraunhofer research institutes), Henkel BeautyCare (whose Social Plastic Ecosystem in partnership with the Plastic Bank social enterprise is aimed at stopping ocean plastic and simultaneously providing opportunities for people in poverty), Procter & Gamble s Tide Eco-Box (which contains less packaging, 60% less plastic and 30% less water than the current Tide press-tap) and many more."
MGMT343,Strategic Management of Public Issues and Campaigns,"The course focuses on the strategic management of public issues and the implementation of campaigns around these issues. Public information campaigns play an important role in educating, informing and affecting change. Discussion of the effectiveness of these campaigns and the channels used to communicate with the target audience will be part of the conversations in the classroom. The stakeholder theory, the role of coalitions and the tools for public policy implementation will be used in the analysis of campaign outcomes. The course will include environmental scanning and intelligence to highlight the need to contextualise an issue: a public issue does not stand alone but is placed within an ecosystem of variable factors, associated with ambiguity and complexity."
MGMT345,"Digital Media, Entertainment & E-commerce Ecosystem","This course is designed to help students develop an in-depth understanding and analysis of strategic business challenges and opportunities in the dynamic and complex environment of Digital Media and Entertainment E-Commerce Ecosystem (DMEEE) in Asia. Value co-creation is an integral performance outcome in digital platform ecosystems. In developing their digital strategies, leading companies in these systems increasingly aggregate and analyze data from both e-commerce activities and media content consumption to gain a multifaceted understanding of their customers, and to develop deep knowledge about media, entertainment, and e-commerce. As tech titans like Amazon, Netflix, Alibaba, Tencent, and Bytedance redefine the DMEEE landscape in Singapore and Southeast Asia, other ecosystem players including media firms, entertainment firms, manufacturers and retailers are presented with the challenge of developing their own digital strategies to thrive. This elective will introduce key concepts in strategic management in DMEEE and involve students in real-life strategic business challenges from Mediacorp, Singapore's leading media and entertainment group, and JUMBO Group, a leading multi-dining concept F&B group which owns JUMBO Seafood, and Love, Afare.

Participants will have the opportunity to engage business leaders in project discussions."
MGMT346,Global Trade and Maritime Work-Study Elective,"This programme is a collaboration between SMU and industry partners in the global trade and maritime sector to build a future ready talent pipeline for the industry. It provides SMU students with the opportunity to undergo a five-month extended internship programme at a partner company in the global trade and maritime sector. This elective is open to all Year 2, Year 3 and Year 4 students who meet the necessary criteria. Students will be paid a stipend / allowance during the extended internship period. Students with the International Trading Track (ITT) or the Maritime Business and Operations Track (MBOT) will be awarded the WSE Award of $5,000 upon graduation."
MGMT348,Family Office Management Work-Study Elective,"Asian entrepreneurs, tycoons, and affluent families are preparing to hand over an estimated S$2.6 trillion of business and wealth assets to the next generation over the coming decade. Many are setting up family offices to facilitate this succession planning and wealth transfer.

Family offices are privately owned entities that manage the private wealth and other affairs of the family including philanthropy, education, and estate planning. In Singapore, family offices are required to have at least $10 million of assets under management (AUM), with many more than $100 million in AUM. Beyond managing the family wealth, the family office also supports the family s vision and legacy, and helps to support important transitions in ownership, leadership, and wealth.

Singapore has gained prominence as the preferred base for family offices, with their numbers doubling to 400 in 2020 as compared to the year before. This trend is expected to continue. Family offices by nature are private, closely held entities. However, with the phenomenal increase in the number of family offices, there is a corresponding spike in demand for professionals familiar with managing the family office.

The BFI Family Office Management Work-Study Elective is a collaboration with family offices and their advisors that will provide students with the opportunity to undergo a 5-month extended internship programme in a partner company. Most family offices are led by family principals and staffed by small teams of senior professionals with decades of experience.

Hence, the work-study elective presents valuable opportunities for students to take on a broader range of responsibilities and to learn directly from senior management, compared to junior internships at a larger corporate organization.

The BFI Family Office Management Work-Study Elective involves an internship locally, where students enrolled will work for at least four days each week at the host company and take courses on campus for up to one day each week for up to five months.

While undertaking this elective, students may enroll in up to 2 course units (CU) of courses, as long as there is no timetable clash with the internship requirements.

This Work-Study Elective is open to all SMU students who meet the pre-requisites."
MGMT349,Management Consulting Work-Study Elective,"This programme is a collaboration between SMU and a leading company in the management consulting industry. It provides students with the opportunity to undergo a structured five-month extended internship programme at the management consulting company. Interested students will be shortlisted by the school and competitively selected by the company. An SMU faculty member will also provide supervision during this internship.

The global consulting market is expected to continue its strong growth with the demand for consulting professionals remaining high. Students enrolled in this work-study elective will learn firsthand how to work within a team in the consulting industry and apply the necessary consulting tools in solving strategic issues for organizations in a wide range of industries. They will also learn about:
- Communication
- Client management
- Business building
- Growth opportunities identification"
MGMT350,Overseas Entrepreneurship Work-Study Elective,"The importance of entrepreneurship to the economy is intuitive. More formally, numerous independent studies from credible sources have spoken at length about this. A quick search across the internet shows that the benefits of entrepreneurship include but are not limited to the following: accelerating economic growth, promoting innovation, promoting social changes, promoting research and industrial development, and developing and improving existing enterprises. Start-ups and small businesses also have a disproportionate impact on job creation, accounting for 64% of new jobs and contributing to 20 percent of gross job creation. , , , ,

In Singapore, a survey in 2012 as part of a Global Entrepreneurship Monitoring study indicates that 21.4% of people in Singapore intend to start a company in the next three years, ranked second among OECD countries.  This indicates the great interest for entrepreneurship in Singapore alone. Beyond this, the trend for entrepreneurship investment in China, India, and Southeast Asia is also encouraging. Both from the input (number of graduates and family business) as well as from the demand (number of deals and capital invested by angel investors and Venture Capitalists along with the amount that governments invested as limited partners). 

The importance of entrepreneurship, however, goes beyond job creation. It provides an ideal setting to train and equip individuals with skills they need for the future. While the future always seems uncertain, McKinsey, one of the leading management consultant firms in the world, has suggested that cognitive capability, interpersonal skills, and self-leadership are critical part of it. These are all skills that entrepreneurship is rather uniquely positioned to train."
MGMT601A,Strategy,"This course is designed to study strategy and related issues that affect the success of the entire organization. This course introduces the theory and tools of critical and effective strategic analysis, and thinking. This seminar concentrates on current theoretical and empirical research relating to emerging areas of knowledge in the strategic management field. It reflects the emphasis of current research on strategic and organizational phenomena."
MGMT602,Strategy & Organisation,"This course is designed to teach strategy and the organizational changes, and leadership necessary to create competitive success. A key aspect of strategic success is execution, without which ideas remain only ideas and not vehicles for value creation. The topics of execution by way of the organization, management and change leadership will be discussed in detail. Lectures, case studies, readings, simulations, tools and their practical use, as well as class participation will be the primary vehicle to create the appropriate learning environment. The outcome of this course will be an effective theoretical and practical understanding by the students of strategic analysis, formulation, execution, and the role and practice of leadership, management and organization."
MGMT603,Entrepreneurship & Business Creation,"This course aims to introduce the students to the concept and value of entrepreneurship in a wider context, the theoretical models and practice of entrepreneurial process and their application in various organizational contexts. It seeks to develop a critical understanding of key issues in entrepreneurship, including implications of entrepreneurship, paths to entrepreneurship, and environments for entrepreneurship. Participants will analyze theoretical and practical arguments on entrepreneurial opportunities, strategies and tools for various types of entrepreneurial processes and management. They will compare and contrast different theoretical approaches to entrepreneurship and enterprise development in different types of organizations."
MGMT604,Management Theory,"This course provides an understanding of the foundational concepts and empirical studies in management. It surveys the development of management theories and an analysis of the current trends in management thoughts. It examines how scholars construct theories to explain organizational phenomena. The course will review basic writings, research and theories on management. In the light of the vast body of knowledge, only selected issues of interest in the management field will be explored in depth."
MGMT605,Introduction to Research,"This course introduces students to the foundations of research design for management research. It will explore selection of the research question, research design, literature review, and writing and publishing management research. It will introduce selected qualitative methods for data collection and analysis such as ethnography, interviewing, observation, and computer-aided methods of data analysis; and selected quantitative methods for data collection such as experiments, surveys, and secondary data analysis. At the end of the course, the participants should have prepared a draft of their thesis proposal."
MGMT606,Social Entrepreneurship,"Social entrepreneurship examines the process of creating new independent or corporate ventures that pursue the dual primary missions of social benefit and financial return on investment. Hence, the course concerns itself with nonprofit organisations and for profit ventures that have a social mission and aim to be financially self-sufficient or are profit driven. This course is designed as an introduction to the field. It examines the obstacles and constraints faced by social entrepreneurs, a nd surfacing new strategies for them. The course will draw on practitioners as well as on historical and contemporary models to explore the unique range of issues and challenges facing the new social venture. The course invites students to explore solutions to societal problems and to evaluate the market opportunities for social venture creation, the social capital markets and the trade off between social and financial returns, and resource issues. The course will examine the unique management and marketing strategies for the growing social venture. The research seminars will cover the areas of enquiry in nonprofit management and the differences between social entrepreneurship and traditional management and innovation."
MGMT607,International Business Research Seminar,"This research seminar supplements MGMT205  International Business .  The principal aim of this seminar is to overview the academic literature and research methods in International Business.  The seminar introduces participants to seminal papers and to current trends in International Business research.   In the process, seminar participants will learn to formulate relevant research questions, design research methods, and review academic papers in the field of International Business."
MGMT608,Qualitative Research Methods,"This course introduces students to qualitative research methods. Qualitative methods refers to a variety of research techniques that are non-statistical in nature, involve gathering data first hand from  primary sources  (i.e. by observing or interviewing people or organizations), and form a complementary research approach to statistical and other quantitative techniques. Qualitative methods help researchers develop insights into new phenomena, into process, and into complex relationships that are not easily ascertained with other methods.

The course will introduce qualitative methods from four perspectives. One is by formally studying and practicing the practices of the methods. The second is by studying formative qualitative pieces of research. The third is by understanding the strengths of qualitative research, in studying complex systems with interacting actors or subsystems, and in studying process. The fourth is by examining some of the techniques (as practiced in the real world) in contrast to how they might be practiced (or adapted) to other, specifically virtual, worlds."
MGMT609,Quantitative Research Methods,"A large proportion of contemporary research on organization, strategy, and management relies on quantitative research methods. This course is designed to provide the statistical background and to familiarize the students with some of the commonly used quantitative research techniques, including ordinary least squares multivariate regression, models for binary outcomes, count models, and pooled cross-section/time series analysis.

The main objective of this course is to help students understand the relationship between theory, data and statistical methods. This is not a course in statistical theory (i.e. we will not be deriving likelihood functions etc.) but a course on the practical use of statistical techniques to answer management related research questions. We will spend considerable time thinking about theoretical insights that can be translated into testable propositions, and how these propositions are best tested. We will do this through discussions of published papers from leading journals or high quality working papers in management research, and by having you solve statistical problems, work with data and estimate models. At the end of the course, you should be able to use common statistical methods to ask and answer research questions, and have developed critical skills in evaluating others  research, such that you may apply these skills to your own thesis and other research works."
MGMT611,Operations Management,"When companies produce and deliver goods or services to meet customer demand, they do so by executing business processes.  In this course, students discover how business processes can be designed, analyzed and improved to lift the performance of any organization, whether it is a bank, a hospital, a resort, or a fashion retailer.  The course reveals how process management skills can be used to reduce costs, lower inventories, cut waiting times, improve quality, enhance service levels, and increase revenues and company profits.  Specifically, students will gain practical knowledge of process design, demand forecasting, capacity planning, workflow planning and control, quality management, and lean operations. With a focus on the basic concepts that govern process management, the course also provides the necessary foundation to pursue further development in operations and supply chain management."
MGMT611A,Operations Management,"When companies produce and deliver goods or services to meet customer demand, they do so by managing operations, in other words by  executing business processes.

The course reveals how process management skills can be used to reduce costs, lower inventories, cut waiting times, improve quality, enhance service levels, and increase revenues and company profits.   Specifically, students will gain practical knowledge of process design, demand forecasting, capacity planning, workflow planning and control, quality management, and lean operations. With a focus on the basic concepts that govern process management, the course also provides the necessary foundation to pursue further development in operations and supply chain management."
MGMT612,Enterprise Growth and Development,"Many new ventures experience failure during growing their businesses Growth creates new challenges that have to be met. This course considers the growth stages of the firm beyond the startup and survival phase. In the growth of the new venture, both the firm and its founder(s) are likely to go through some considerable transitions. We focus on managerial issues during different phases of the new venture s expansion and transitions and offer management tools that are needed to capture value from entrepreneurial activities and to build a new venture into a significant enterprise."
MGMT614A,Corporate Strategy,"This course introduces students to the theoretical concepts and analytical tools required for formulating and implementing appropriate strategies that affect the enduring success of the entire organization. Topics covered include external and internal environmental analyses, business-level strategies, corporate-level strategies, strategy process and implementation, and special topics such as competitive dynamics and competition in high tech industries. This course emphasizes the application of theory to the real world strategic issues. Students are encouraged to synthesize their existing knowledge and experience in various industries into a comprehensive understanding of strategy."
MGMT615,Global Economy: Issues and Challenges,"This course provides students with an understanding of the major changes and developments in the global economy and the key challenges arising from globalization. Such understanding is essential in assessing the business and political risks in the global business environment. Students will gain a practical knowledge of key changes affecting international trade, cross-border labor and capital flows, monetary policy, exchange rates and the global financial sector development, as well as the roles that governments, central banks and multilateral institutions play in these changes."
MGMT618,Agile and Disruptive Strategy,"This module touches on disruptive innovation and industry transformation. Participants will look at business model innovation, creating market-appropriate customer value proposition, business model innovation in emerging market, effective strategy execution (managing complexity and unexpected), and developing non-market strategy to shape value system for disruptive innovation."
MGMT619,Innovation and Growth Management,"Necessity is the mother of invention. One reason for firms to innovate is the necessity to re-invent themselves and get out of stagnation: the industry has either gotten obsolete, or competitors have adopted newer and more efficient business models, and products or services based on more advanced technologies. Innovation is then a necessity as the firm has to innovate or perish, one only has to look at what happened to Blockbuster and Kodak. Blockbuster at one point of time was the leading media rental firm in the world, but they chose to ignore innovation in the way they were delivering their media content to customers. As Netflix gained scale, Blockbuster s inability to innovate meant that their business model was obsolete, and they had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Kodak is another famous example: Steven Sasson at Kodak invented the digital camera way back in the 1970s, but rather than developing and commercializing the innovation, Kodak chose to put the new technology on the backburner, as its commercialization would have meant that their existing business model that relied on chemical printing of photographs would have to be cannibalized. However, other competitors jumped on the bandwagon for competitive advantage: hence, if you do not pursue innovation, your competitors will make you obsolete someday, no product or business model has an eternal shelf life. Innovation has many dimensions: it creates value for existing customers, thereby letting you keep your current market share; it creates value for new customers, enabling you to get growth; it enables you to work with new processes to access a lower cost base; supplier innovation enables you to leverage partners  innovation capabilities to offer value to customers, and capture value for yourself. So the notion of continuous improvement is indeed extendable to continuous innovation, the business world in all sectors moves on a treadmill; the pace of the treadmill is faster in some industries like technology and fashion, and slower in some other industries. Innovation is the lever that enables you to keep pace on the treadmill if you are at the industry average; and enables you to set the pace if you innovate at a faster rate than the industry average. If you stand still on the treadmill or run at a slower pace than the treadmill in a competitive environment, at some stage, you will be thrown off the treadmill.

This course should be of particular interest to people aspiring for a career in designing and managing for innovation, either directly (e.g., V.P. of R&D, R&D Manager) or indirectly (e.g., management consulting). The course will also be useful to SME proprietors and entrepreneurs who intend to serve new markets, or use new technologies, or participants who wish to strategically reposition their offerings in an existing market. The course should also be of interest to people who manage interfaces between innovation and business functions such as finance, marketing, managerial accounting and human resources."
MGMT630,Innovation Development: Turning Concepts into Business Cases,"This course introduces students to the basic conceptual frameworks and tools for translating  ideas  into concepts and making a business case out of them. To achieve these objectives, the students will go through readings to take into account the innovation processes and experiences of successful firms in different industries and also view things from the perspective of an entrepreneur. The course will be taught in the form of lectures and in-depth case study discussions. The students are expected to carefully read the assigned cases and come prepared to class."

MGMT632,Corporate Social Responsibility,"Traditional economists argue the central and sole goal of a business is to maximize returns to shareholders. A weakness with this mindset is that it puts profits above all else and thereby ignores that companies are social organizations that serve employees, suppliers, and communities in which they operate. This profit-only mindset can raise significant problems when companies do not view their mission in a wider context, such as illustrated by BP and the oil spill disaster, and at worst be the seed of destruction for amoral firms like Enron.

This module explores the compelling reasons behind businesses taking on a broader role in developing social value that extends beyond the role of the firm as viewed by traditional economists. The module provides ideas, conceptual frameworks and tools to help students assess approaches to social value alignment and different models of interaction between corporations, governments, intergovernmental organizations, investors, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

This module is practitioner-oriented and intended to provide the participants with a basis for working with and advising business leaders in developing strategic social value alignment, and engage customers through social marketing, and build and understanding of firm level social strategy, dynamics of relationships between companies and stakeholders. Leaders of non-profit and government agencies will also find the module of benefit as it covers public-private relationships and will help identify how to work with business leaders on areas of business responsibility.

Social issues are wide a varied and include environmental management, health, education, social justice, labour standards, social mobility, climate change, and more. A full treatment of these topics is beyond the scope of this module. Instead, this module will provide broad frameworks and analytical tools for managing social value and stakeholder relationships, and provide illustrative examples though a guest speaker series to bring ideas to life.  Learning by doing  is the centre piece of this course which features a practicum style project where a team will work on realizing greater value for a firm they select to support."
MGMT633,Strategic Initiative Project,"Strategic Initiative Project is an approach that challenges you to learn through immersion in a real problem. It is a format that develops problem solving strategies and sector knowledge bases and skills by placing you in the active role of problem solvers confronted with an ill-structured situation that simulates the kind of problems you are likely to face as managers in complex organisations.

SIP makes a fundamental shift from a focus on teaching to a focus on learning. The process is aimed at using the power of authentic problem solving to engage you and enhance your learning and motivation. There are several unique aspects that define the SIP approach: Learning takes place within the contexts of currently occurring tasks, issues and problems. That is, these are truly real-world concerns."
MGMT636,Corporate Strategy in a Global Environment,"Generally, strategy is defined as a set of choices that managers make in order to increase their firm s performance relative to competitors. Corporate Strategy in a Global Environment considers strategic choices that managers make in the context of a multi-product, multi-business, multi-location firm. In this course, you will study how successful organizations choose, implement, and evaluate their strategy. The focus will lie on internal and external corporate growth strategies, which have become indispensable for success in today s economic environment marked by increased globalization, rapid technological change, shortened product lifecycles, and enhanced competition. Tools and techniques for strategy formulation, implementation, and evaluation are discussed. Case studies are used to sharpen your understanding of the importance of strategic decision-making.

Specific areas of focus are:
- Corporate Strategy and Competitive Advantage
- Corporate Scope
- Growth through Acquisitions
- Global Strategy and International Expansion
- Sustaining a Successful Enterprise"
MGMT638,Network and Alliance Building,"Alliances among companies have become a fundamental necessity for companies  competitive and growth strategies. Firms use alliances for a variety of reasons   to share the risks or costs of entering into new products or markets, to access or learn relevant capabilities, to growth etc. At the same time, alliances are very difficult to manage and poorly conceived or managed alliances often create substantial problems for one or more of the alliance partners. Not surprisingly, more than half the alliances formed end up failing. Therefore, the goal of this program is to understand the benefits and risks that alliances create for individual companies and to learn how to form and manage alliances more successfully. This should help participants build their individual alliance skills as well as understand how their company can develop its organizational capability to manage alliances more effectively."
MGMT639,Business Study Mission,"This course is designed to provide students with a rich understanding of business practices in a world region of great significance in global commerce   particularly for the future.  You will gain background knowledge of the history, culture, politics, and economics of South East Asia, followed by direct experience through a study tour to two important business centers in the area."
MGMT641,Executing Strategy,"In this course we examine the analytic frameworks that can help managers identify viable strategies. These include competitive analysis and the analysis of strategic capabilities. We also study the process of strategy implementation and execution involving organisational issues such as leadership, culture and organisational structure. We use case studies to illustrate processes of strategy formulation and implementation."
MGMT647,"Opportunity Recognition, Ideation and Innovation Management","This course introduces the student to  the front end of innovation . We will explore the theory and will practice Design Thinking, we will also apply the techniques and principles of design thinking through a project that will step through the ideation and opportunity recognition  front end  of innovation. Design Thinking and the tools that support it are a powerful process that can improve product, service and experience concepts (selected applications to products and services will be covered).

In Part 1, the design thinking process (based on the IDEO/Stanford Design School process) is introduced. This is a qualitative process consisting of the stages of: the observation of users, ideation, and prototyping. Iteration can occur between any steps, and multiple cycles are typical. Applications of design thinking to product and service innovation will be discussed, along with varying of the design contexts, including the private sector, government and social sectors. Design thinking will be framed against traditional innovation processes and other types of thinking.

In Part 2, the course will cover theories of innovation management and how to make organizations more innovative."
MGMT649,Creative and Critical Thinking,"This course delivers an understanding of how thinking occurs in the creative mind and organization. The student is led through the practical and theoretical frameworks of abductive thinking (the logic of what might be), inductive thinking (proving by observation that something works), and deductive thinking (proving by reason that something must be). Data collection and the interpretation of patterns and interactions are explored. The use of decision-making tools within these frameworks and game models elucidate the key learning outcomes."
MGMT655,Business Analytics for Decision Making,"The course is designed to guide MBA students to understand and carry out data-driven and data-informed managerial decision-making in business. The course will provide step-by-step guidance on how to execute machine learning methods using computational programming in R, deploying the analytic results into an interactive dashboard, using Shiny.

Students will become able to understand the processes and results of predictive analytics based on supervised (regression and classification) and unsupervised (clustering and dimensionality reduction) machine learning. This will be done in the various contexts of solving business questions: predicting customer attrition, loan default, housing prices, and employee turnover; and housing market and customer segmentation. This eight-week course will provide useful skills in computational data analytics for strategic thinkers in organizations.

The major learning formats will be: (a) the  interactive lecture  where instructors will provide guidance on the principles and executions of predictive analytics, with examples (applications), and (b)  hands-on programming  where students will use their fingertips and modify parts of a given script. (The instructor will provide a template script, so that participants can fill in the blanks as they learn the processes of predictive analytics.)

As there will be discussion of cutting-edge science and technology used in business analytics, the course will be both conceptual and technical (experiential). The experiential (hands-on) learning is the critical component the course will employ hands-on (learn by doing) approaches. To fully understand what can be done and should be done, and so students can use what they learn during the course in their workplaces (or at least envision what could be done, and what questions to ask their organizations  data analytics teams), it is vital to undertake hands-on programming for predictive analytics.

To maximize the speed at which they gain knowledge and skills, enrolled students will receive a pre-course note from the instructor, giving guidance on pre-course reading and preparations from Week 1. There will also be weekly exercise questions, where students will receive a set of structured questions (starting in Week 3), using R and Shiny. Upon completion of each exercise there will be a review session on the exercise questions.


NOTE: The course is designed for students new to data analytics and in an MBA program. It is a hard-skill course in which students will learn about R programming language for predictive analytics.

Again, it is expected that students will have no experience of R programming. In order to fully grasp the course content it is essential for students to practice, both during and after the eight-week course, the programming skills they have learned. Learning R programming is like learning to play the piano practice is of critical importance."
MGMT656,Management & Strategy,"This course provides students with a foundation about business organizations, management functions and strategy implementation.
The first section of the course will introduce concepts about the business organization, its operating environments, leadership, team building and management.
The second half of the course will focus on the process of strategy development and implementation and performance management."
MGMT659,Internship,"It is an intentional supervised learning related to one's field of study and career goals. Internships can be a very structured learning experience or they can be designed to meet the expectations of the student. Internships can be done locally or overseas. They can be part-time or full-time, paid or unpaid. Internships can be done during the academic year. The one thing all good internship opportunities have in common is they provide students with career-related work experience. Internship is done for a 20 week period."
MGMT661,Innovation Strategy Development,"This course introduces students to the theoretical concepts and analytical tools required for formulating and implementing appropriate strategies that affect the innovation success of the entire organization. Topics covered include external and internal environmental analyses, business-level strategies, corporate-level strategies, strategy process and implementation, innovation portfolio design and implementation and special topics such as competitive dynamics and competition in high tech industries. This course emphasizes the application of theory to the real world strategic issues. Students are encouraged to synthesize knowledge from other business courses into a comprehensive understanding of competitive advantage."
MGMT662,Innovation-Focused Strategic Leadership,"This short module introduces students to core concepts in strategic management and how these translate to entrepreneurial ventures. Core concepts to be covered in strategic management include industry analysis, generic strategies and resource-based view through detailed case studies. How these core strategy concepts apply in the setting of new ventures involves careful consideration of potential retaliation from incumbents, how entrepreneurs should plan and recalibrate their product visions based on updated information over time. The focus on entrepreneurship touches on the motivation for entrepreneurs to develop new ventures, as well as stylized facts on new ventures."
MGMT663,Innovation Seminar,The Innovation seminar consists of special innovation sharing sessions. Students are to refer to the seminar details provided.
MGMT663A,Innovation Seminar,The Innovation seminar consists of special innovation sharing sessions. Students are to refer to the seminar details provided.
MGMT665,Supply Chain and Partnership Management,"This course introduces basic concepts that facilitate effective management of companies  supply chains and their business partners. A key aspect of this course is to appreciate the importance of holistically managing one s stakeholder network in support of strategic innovation management and successful commercialization. Topics include connectivation, supply chain strategies, distribution, and fulfillment. The course will be taught in forms of lectures, in-depth case study discussions, and a project. The students are expected to carefully read the assigned cases and come prepared to class."
MGMT668,"Risk Management for an Uncertain World: Focus on Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity","This short module introduces students to core concepts in risk management, with a focus on volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. These so-called VUCA environments (the VUCA acronym was arguably first used by the US Army War College to describe the unpredictable security environment in the late 1990s) mean that traditional strategic plans may not always be applicable, and additional tools must be considered. In the first session, tools including decision trees and scenario planning will be introduced to handle somewhat straightforward cases. In the second session, the importance of crafting solution from ambiguous spaces, as well as well as the notions of commitment and flexibility will be highlighted. In the third and fourth sessions, strategic options and technology-related challenges for specific companies will be examined. You will be asked to position yourself to analyse Apple s current options and innovatory strategic positioning. Using another case on the pharmaceutical industry as background, we will examine the technological waves of change and attempt to foresee the future managerial challenges of Merck and Pfizer."
MGMT672,Strategy,"This course introduces students to the theoretical concepts and analytical tools required for formulating and implementing appropriate strategies that affect the enduring success of the entire organization. Topics covered include external and internal environmental analyses, business-level strategies, corporate-level strategies, and innovation strategies. This course emphasizes the application of theory to a number of real world cases. Students are encouraged to synthesize knowledge from other business courses into a comprehensive understanding of firms  competitive advantages."
MGMT673,Inside India: Discovering the New Realities,"The dramatic rise of India as an economic superpower has been one of the most significant results of globalization. With a strong knowledge workforce, rising income level, an open regulatory environment and a consistent GDP growth, India is now positioned to be at the fore-front of both supply-side efficiency as well as new market opportunities.

However, it is imperative to have a first-hand understanding of the Indian business scenario, regulatory norms and diverse culture to effectively tap into this market. This course on Inside India: Discovering the New Realities will give participants an insider s view of the dynamic markets of India, its business environment, socio-cultural norms, and emerging opportunities."
MGMT674,"Business, Government and Society","This course focuses on the increasingly important non-market business environment   the political, regulatory, social, and ecological context in which contemporary global business operates. The nonmarket environment poses significant challenges to managers, whilst offering tremendous opportunities for the development of competitive advantage. You will learn to analyse political environments, discern systematic differences in the business environment across countries and cultures, and formulate nonmarket strategies in a global context."
MGMT680,Competitive and Corporate Strategy,"In this course of strategic management, the students will be exposed to the analysis of complex competitive situations that require a multidisciplinary approach from the perspective of top management.

Through the discussion of cases and related readings, the course focuses on strategic analysis and how to build competitive advantage at the business and corporate levels in our global economy. The main theories, models and tools within the field of strategy will be covered with a strong emphasis in its application to real settings. We will use the tools that help top management analyze the business environment, formulate strategies and make decisions in competitive situations.

The course is divided in three parts.

The first part introduces tools to understand the industry structure and economics that determinate industry-wide profitability and are the base of every individual firm s business strategy and resulting profitability, focusing on both resource/organizational and positional aspects.
The second part studies firm and industry dynamics, focusing on the changes in competition and the reaction of individual firms to the changes in their environment. We will use basic game theory as a tool to analyze competitive interactions when the number of players is small and the industry is being shaped by the interactions between those players. We will look at issues such as bargaining power, price competition, entry and exit decisions, standard setting and platform and technology based competition.

In the third part of the course we will work at the corporate and international strategy level and we will take a close look at the most fundamental issue in management. Why does one business meet its objectives, while another firm, apparently equally strong, fail? The goal of any firm is to develop a winning strategy and to build a successful organization. This is a tough job. So let us begin with the most obvious of facts: every organization is different. From this simple fact we can derive something quite useful for us as strategists: different firms in the same sector will have different strategies. A key reason is that the management teams evaluate differently the competitive environment and hence decide on different strategies but success does not depend solely on selecting a winning strategy: the achievement of results depends as well on the effectiveness of management. We must ask ourselves why one firm builds a strong, adaptive organization capable of creating and responding to competitive strategy, while a second firm patches together an organization that stumbles from initiative to initiative?"
MGMT681,Entrepreneurial Management,"This course provides a forum for the in-depth examination of mindsets, methods, and managerial activities that follow the entrepreneurial process, from opportunity recognition to growing the venture. While the most visible outcome of this course is a written opportunity report, we will also examine entrepreneurship from a managerial perspective, covering a wide area of issues that emerge with starting and growing new ventures
  be they independent or corporate projects.

The 8 sessions that compose this course aim to give you a well-rounded learning experience, which will enable you to develop skills and apply tools vital in today s business world, whether you explore it as an entrepreneur or a corporate manager. The theory you will receive from lectures and class readings will serve as a backbone to a range of hands-on experiences through case discussions, coaching sessions, teamwork, and so forth. By keeping the class experience on the interface between theory and practice, the course structure will lead you through the entrepreneurial process.

The cases, exercises, and projects will expose you to viewpoints on both sides of the table   that of the entrepreneur and that of the investor. Moreover, the settings in our case studies cover a range of industries and markets, from ventures backed by sophisticated investors to those funded by friends. By exposing you to a broad range of settings in which entrepreneurs  operate, the intent is to break the myth that entrepreneurship is limited to a few heroic figures covered in popular press, but if we so desire, accessible to all of us.

This entrepreneurship course is envisioned as a highly interactive class, where students learn from each other s experiences through class discussion. In that sense, while I will do my best to provide you with interesting materials and facilitate discussion to highlight learning points, much of your learning depends on your preparation, participation, and contribution.

Upon the completion of this course, participants should:

- Know how to recognize and evaluate venture opportunities, understanding both the entrepreneur s and the investor s perspective;

- Understand the issues faced by entrepreneurs when starting a venture, as well as acquire some of the fundamental skills and tools required for embarking on a new project in an independent and in a corporate context;

- Understand the nature of opportunities in the context of new and/or growing ventures and be able to write a good opportunity report."
MGMT682,Strategic Management,"This course introduces students to the theoretical concepts and analytical tools required for formulating and implementing appropriate strategies that affect the enduring success of the entire organization. Topics covered include external and internal environmental analyses, competitive strategies, corporate strategies, international strategy, merger and acquisitions and strategic alliances. This course emphasizes the application of theory to a number of real world strategic issues. Students are encouraged to synthesize knowledge from other business courses into a comprehensive understanding of firms  competitive advantages."
MGMT683,Critical Thinking,"This course delivers an understanding of how critical thinking occurs in the creative mind and organization leader. Participants are led through the practical and theoretical frameworks of abductive thinking (the logic of what might be), inductive thinking (proving by observation that something works), and deductive thinking (proving by reason that something must be). Data collection and the interpretation of patterns and interactions are explored. The use of decision-making tools within these experiential frameworks and game models elucidate key learning outcomes. The focus is on cultivating skills that will be of long-term practical use. In particular, the course aims to strengthen Situational Intelligence (SQ) and Collaborative Intelligence (CQ), which are the major skill components of the 21st Century Competencies internationally recognized as key drivers of future career success."
MGMT684,Managing Innovation and Growth,"This course emphasizes three truly defining aspects in the creation of innovative growth within any enterprise: innovation, entrepreneurship and leadership. Frameworks are introduced to clarify how innovation (the creation of value), entrepreneurship (the pursuit of opportunity), and leadership combine to create sustainable value and growth. Additional frameworks are introduced to guide the process of analysis: Value, Opportunity, Impact and Risk (VOIR); is presented with case studies and tool practice to understand how a growth manager must consider all four components in their leadership. In this course, we expand our understanding  of  innovation  and   entrepreneurship  to   characterize  growth management in new ventures as well as in the established enterprise."
MGMT685,Team Projects,"The Team Projects course provides MBA students the opportunity to engage in self-directed learning in a real-world business environment with the support of a faculty advisor. Students work in teams of five to six students and are engaged to create strategic change at client organizations. The client defined projects last the duration of the programme and can range from best practice implementation, process improvement, new product/service design, expansion planning, market entry, to design and implementation of specific functional strategies (HR, marketing, operations, etc.). Teams are required to apply the principles of evidence-based management to the specified business opportunity at the client organization. A team project will involve data collection, data analysis, best-practice research, action planning, implementation and evaluation. The main objective in this course is for students to gain confidence in managing a wide range of real-world business projects by enhancing their research, analysis, thinking, planning, project management, communication, collaboration, negotiation and presentation skills in a real setting."
MGMT687,Business Study Mission,"This course is designed to provide students with a rich understanding of business practices in a world region of great significance in global commerce   particularly for the future.  You will gain background knowledge of the history, culture, politics, and economics of South East Asia, followed by direct experience through a study tour to two important business centers in the area."
MGMT694,Human Capital and Global Business Strategy,"This introductory course is designed to provide a broad overview of critical dimensions of human capital in the context of business strategy. Starting with the origins of the concept of human capital, we explore the direct and indirect influences of organization structure, strategic leadership, organization culture, and talent management on human capital as a resource of the firm. We will provide a common grounding in each of the topics through practice perspectives and bring these to life with case studies along with student sharing. To help bridge the link to academic research, we will also anchor to key points in the literature."
MGMT696,Design Thinking and Creative Problem Solving,"This course introduces students to new venture creation and design thinking tools for identifying new and better ways of providing products and services that meet customer expectations. In Part 1, the opportunity recognition process is introduced. We will look at how external factors (context, available resources) and intrinsic factors (motivation, network, risk propensity) interact to create opportunities that an entrepreneur then chooses to seize.

In Part 2, the qualitative design thinking process (based on the IDEO/Stanford Design School process) is introduced (empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test). Applications of design thinking to product and service innovation will be discussed, along with varying of the design contexts, including the private sector, government and social sectors. Participants learn to think like innovators, from the initial idea to managing resources, building partnerships with committed stakeholders and dealing with contingencies. In parallel, participants are encouraged to consider their individual accomplishments and how these might support new venture creation. Participants will work on past accomplishments, chartering the skills, knowledge and abilities that create a unique set of means with which to drive their own innovation projects."
MGMT698,Strategic Management,"This course introduces students to the theoretical concepts and analytical tools required for formulating and implementing appropriate strategies that affect the enduring success of the entire organization. Topics covered include external and internal environmental analyses, competitive strategies, corporate strategies, international strategy, merger and acquisitions and strategic alliances. This course emphasizes the application of theory to a number of real world strategic issues. Students are encouraged to synthesize knowledge from other business courses into a comprehensive understanding of firms  competitive advantages."
MGMT701,Theory Construction and Research Design,"This course provides an overview of the scientific research process, and the interrelationships of its various components. It focuses on the iterative nature of theory construction and testing, and the factors that need to be considered in order to develop useful theories and sound empirical tests of theories."
MGMT705,Seminar in Strategic Management,"This course is designed to provide a strong foundation for critical thinking in the area of strategic management focusing on economics of organizations. This course will be run as a seminar examining theories and empirical studies of strategic management. It will be inter-disciplinary. Some non-technical economics/finance articles may be included in the reading list.

To encourage learning, students are expected to actively participate in class discussions. You should read carefully all required readings before each class. You should be ready to talk about the main message, methodological sophistications, and possible extensions of the papers under required readings.

Each week, papers in the reading list will be individually assigned.  A one to two page (typed, single spaced) critical summary of the assigned paper will be required from each student, before class (Bring enough copies to the class to distribute to all the participants). In discussion, avoid simple summary. Rather focus on critique and possible extensions.

The summary may include:

1. What is the main research question of the paper? Is this an important question?
2. What are the assumptions in the paper? Are they valid? Why or why not?
3. How is the paper designed? Is the empirical method appropriate?
4. What are the conclusions of the paper? Does the paper answer the questions proposed?
5. What is the possible way of extension? How would you proceed?
6. How would you position the article among the assigned readings or in the field?"
MGMT706,International Business Theories,"The goal of this course is to provide a solid theoretical basis for further research in International Business and Management. The course will survey efficiency-based theories and empirical studies of the existence and scope of the multinational enterprise (MNE) and its alternatives, such as long-term contracts, licensing and franchising. We will also discuss (1) the strategies used by firms to enter foreign markets, such as ownership and establishment mode strategies, (2) the costs facing firms entering foreign markets, and (3) the dynamics of their foreign expansion. Hence the main question that this course will discuss is  why do MNEs exist, and what determines the strategies they follow. 

Given the limited time available, we will not directly discuss theories of international trade and comparative advantage, international finance, interactions of multinational firms and governments, and the impact of multinational firms on competition. However, what we will discuss has important bearings on these topics."
MGMT707,Special Topics in Strategic Management,"This course will cover different specialized areas of prominent current research streams in the area of empirical strategic management research. The readings, in-class discussions, and the assignments will bring the students up to date on the current developments in these areas, as well as providing them with a sufficient understanding of the fundamentals."
MGMT708,Strategic Management I,"This course provides an introduction the common research topics in strategic management. The course is designed to provide broad coverage of the most important research streams in strategy, rather than provide an in-depth coverage of any one topic."
MGMT709,Organisation Theory,This course provides a survey of and introduction to some of the major areas of research in organisation theory.
MGMT710,Innovation Strategy,"Innovation Strategy sets the broad framework for how and why organisations innovate and organise themselves for innovation. In this course, we will address broader issues of opportunity recognition, innovation management, innovation portfolio management, technology and patenting strategy, open innovation models and multinational innovation strategy. This is intended as a survey course that exposes us to the broader challenges in organizational innovation."
MGMT711,Innovation Development,"Part 1: This course provides an introduction to design thinking and design methods. Design techniques have become a popular means of teaching people how to innovate, and especially so for the early stages of innovation. The techniques are ideal for not only problem solving but also for problem finding. The main components are as follow:

  An introduction to the whole design thinking cycle via the Stanford  Wallet
  exercise  (or the design of its equivalent), which roughly follows the
  observation/ideate/prototype process.
  An introduction to field research techniques (primarily, interviewing and
  observational study).
  Ideation techniques such as brainstorming, and its comparison with a few other
  ideation techniques.
  Rough or low fidelity (so-called) prototyping methods using simple materials to
  achieve form and three-dimensionality, but without mechanical functionality.

Each session is followed by a more academic discussion that discusses topics such as the strengths and weaknesses of various techniques. Students will also be exposed to the design studies tradition.

Part 2: The second part of this course provides an overview of the innovation development process and the decisions that are made in the innovation development process. These decisions include:
  the product definition (conceptualization and specifications to be included in the
  product), the sharpness/fuzziness of the definition, the timing of the definition.
  the design and formation of innovation teams, building trust between the different
  partners, and the role of diversity, and
  the management of risk in new product development, and the study of risk
  management practices."
MGMT712,Global Strategy and Strategic Management,"In this course, we examine the main analytical and theoretical frameworks in strategic management. These include competitive analysis, the resource-based view of the firm, dynamic capabilities, global strategic perspectives, and processes of strategy realisation and implementation.

This course, therefore, introduces doctoral students to research theories in strategic management. The field of strategic management is concerned with understanding the sources of a firm s comparative advantage (if any) as a prerequisite for understanding the firm s performance. The field is distinct because of its focus on major business goals, the definition of a firm s scope of business, the search for sustainable competitive advantage, and the adoption of a top management integrative perspective on a firm s operations.
Because strategy is concerned with matching organizational resources with environmental opportunities, strategy research has naturally drawn on economics and organization theory as its two base disciplines. We are going to build on this evolution. We will try to cover the key theoretical foundations and areas of application in class and point to other important readings and applications as we go along."
MGMT713,Product Strategy,"Product Strategy examines several themes of what influences a company or new venture to plan for its products, as well as their broad experiences in that.  The perspective will include industrial ecology and competitive positions, as well as resources and capabilities. Topics will include product entry by different types of firms as well as product line management, and platforms as products."
MGMT714,Seminar in Strategy Process,"This course on strategy process is designed to complement the seminar that covers the foundations of strategic management.  Over the past three decades, advances in strategy have been increasingly separated into two relatively distinct streams of research. One of these focuses more on the role of industry characteristics and firm actions in the development of competitive advantage.  By contrast, the other stream tries to examine the influence of various organizational processes on the actions and decisions of a firm that a firm takes over time.  We shall examine the origins of this split and gain a better understanding of the distinctive characteristics of strategy process.

We will also cover some of the key areas of strategy process research.  In each of these, we will examine both conceptual and empirical papers that have contributed over time to our knowledge of the topic.  In discussing the papers on a particular topic, we will focus on the various theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches that have been used to investigate different questions.

For the most part, these topics have been arranged in historical order.  We begin with older areas of strategy process and gradually move to more recent topics.  Although we will deal with most of the significant process topics, the list is not designed to be exhaustive.  Strategy process represents a vast field, which is still growing.  This course should give you a basic overview of both the potential and the challenges of this distinctive perspective of strategy."
MGMT715,Operations Management,"Businesses create value by supplying their products or services to satisfy customer demand. The inflexible nature of supply and demand often leads to mismatches between the available supply and the customer demand. This leads to severe economic consequences on account of unsatisfied customers or wasted resources. In Operations Management (POM), we will study techniques that limit both the incidence and consequence of these supply-demand mismatches. Using research articles and examples from a wide range of industries, we will illustrate that firms that employ these techniques to better match supply with demand enjoy a significant competitive advantage. We will also study various tools and issues of current interest in operations management."
MGMT716,Growth Management,"In this course, we will address broader issues of managing growth and growing ventures.  This is intended as a survey course that exposes us to the broader challenges in organizational innovation, growth, business models, and the related functional issues associated with growing and sustaining a business."
MGMT717,Research Methods I,"This course provides an overview of the scientific research process, and the interrelationships of its various components. It focuses on the iterative nature of theory construction and testing, and the factors that need to be considered in order to develop useful theories and sound empirical tests of theories."
MGMT718,Research Methods II,"This course provides an overview of the scientific research process, and the interrelationships of its various components. It focuses on the iterative nature of theory construction and testing, and the factors that need to be considered in order to develop useful theories and sound empirical tests of theories."
MGMT719,Strategic Management II,"The course involves six face-to-face class sessions held on the SMU campus. Sessions 1~5 will consist of a three or four-hour discussion during which a collection of article will be openly discussed and debated. The purpose of these sessions is to introduce conceptual material to fuel analysis and new conceptual developments. Session 6 will differ in that each student will present an idea for an original research project that is suggested by the week s readings and discussions. Student will be given 20 minutes in total (15 mins for presentation; 5 mins for Q&A) for their Session 6 presentation.

The success depends on active student attention to the material at hand. Attempts to integrate the material with other courses and/or student projects are welcome. Through this and other courses students should develop an appreciation for the varied trajectories of strategic management research, and start to plot positions for themselves on those trajectories.

The class, to the extent possible, will be student directed. For some portion of each class, one student will take responsibility for preparing and facilitating the class discussion. During the seminars, students will be asked to place ideas and concepts within the domain of strategy, in an attempt to foster the development of competing and/or complementary perspectives across varied disciplines or varied strategy problems.

The ultimate objective is to help future strategy teachers understand, appreciate, and use concepts from the field in their educational and scholarly pursuits. In addition, the course will expose students to the nature of academic research and the social context of the field of strategy, and it will help prepare them for doing independent work."
MGMT720,Supply Chain Innovation,"Businesses create value by supplying their products or services to satisfy customer demand. This involves acquiring and organizing resources as well as partnering with suppliers in such a way that the targeted range of products and services are delivered to customers dependably in a costly and timely manner. A common challenge is the inflexible nature of supply and demand, which creates mismatches between the available supply and the customer demand. This leads to severe economic consequences on account of unsatisfied customers or wasted resources. To overcome this challenge and to maintain a competitive position, businesses need to constantly design and implement appropriate operational and supply chain capabilities.  In this course, we will study operations strategy, including manufacturing strategy and the resource based view of the firm, the management of global operations, the role of senior operations executives in the firm, contemporary research in operations strategy, followed by techniques that limit the incidence and consequence of supply-demand mismatches. Throughout the course, the focus will be on how to develop a competitive set of operations and supply chain capabilities. Using research articles and examples from a wide range of industries, we will illustrate that firms that employ these techniques and principles enjoy a significant competitive advantage."

MGMT726,Introductory Research Project,"Empirical analysis is the science of analyzing data to convert information to useful knowledge. The empirical project is intended to provide you with a soft start on doing research with a problem of limited scope. The results of your empirical project can be used in your dissertation, obviously, it will be a small part of your dissertation if you eventually continue to work on the same topic.
In this course you will start to conduct research using empirical methods, which rely on observation and experimentation as a pilot project prior to embarking on your dissertation. This course will enable you to use empirical research methods in your field, with a topic and a data set that you will choose in collaboration with your advisor. If you do not have an advisor at this stage, you can work on your empirical project with any professor that you are interested in working with on research. Topics include the formulation of the question to be investigated and the creation of resulting hypotheses, the collection of data and the analysis of the data collected, and the interpretation and study of analysis results. The methods of data collection and the analysis of data depend on the needs of the research question (to be decided between you and the professor guiding you on the empirical project). These methods include but are not limited to one-on-one interviews, surveys and questionnaires, case study methods, and more involved econometric analysis if you have the right data set. The data can be gathered from publicly available resources."

MGMT729,Research and Design Method,"Research methods in different fields of research in business are diverse in terms of focus, methods used, and analysis, based on the ways that fields have evolved, and the data that can be collected with those methods. However, there are some common underlying themes of research methods across areas, that can be ported across different streams of literature to enable researchers to learn from diverse streams of research. In this course, we will take a deep dive into the research methods used in areas as diverse as Operations Management, Strategy, Economics, OBHR, Accounting and Finance.

Research methods usually vary by the richness of the literature in the desired field of study, Exploratory research is typically conducted at the beginning of the evolution of a field, when the questions associated with a topic are not well understood, studies in this phase are largely driven by observations in the industry, and an understanding of common practices, coupled with theoretical arguments of what constitutes good practice. Gradually, an established theory evolves that becomes the dominant theory to explain the topic, after that, the research on the topic moves to the descriptive phase, in which the research methods used are more detailed, causal effects can be established, and the data gathering and analysis processes are based more on involved econometric analyses. In this course, we will look largely at exploratory research methods used in the areas of as Operations Management, Strategy, Economics, OBHR, Accounting and Finance, as exploratory early stage research typically leads to a higher impact."
MGMT730,Pro-Seminar in Strategic Management & Organisation,The purpose of this course is to introduce area members  main research topics and interests to the new PhD students.

The practical session is built on the foundation of the exercises assigned in the online session. Participants are expected to have completed the exercises before meeting in person."
MGMT6003,Solving a Human Capital Challenge from Business Perspective,"This course provides an opportunity for participants to examine a key human capital challenge from a business perspective, to systematically review and examine the research that informs us on the challenge, and with the information, to design and execute a study to examine the different means by which the challenge can be resolved. The applied nature of the report requires a critical evaluative approach, empirical investigation and analysis and a combination of academic research and business report writing skills."
MGMT6005,Consulting Project,"The practicum course allows students to apply a cross-disciplinary approach while considering both business model and business solution formulation. It prepares students for the complex business environment of today by emphasizing the application of academic knowledge accumulated in prior courses to solving real world problems. The course develops in students an ability to identify problems and develop solutions by analytic review and abstract idea generation. To achieve this, we will take on  real world  business projects as consultants with an expectation of thoughtful analysis, innovative ideas, and professional results."
MGMT6006,Management of Technological Innovations,"This course introduces students to issues pertaining to the management of technological innovations.  Innovations in technology hold huge potential to improve the daily life of ordinary citizens, but can also be risky and uncertain a priori.  Case studies of such innovations will be examined, and tools to manage these risks and uncertainties explained.  In addition, the role of network effects and lock-in for technological innovations, as well as retaliatory actions from competitors will be discussed."
MGMT6007,HC Analytics and Research for Management Insights,"Human capital (HC) decisions are increasingly based on rigorous evidence and analysis. This course is divided into two sections that cover (1) research methods used to generate rigorous evidence and (2) analytical methods used to generate insights for HC decisions.

Research methods represent the  how  of the scientific study of theoretical and applied questions. Appropriate research methods allow us to rigorously investigate and develop evidence to address important problems. This section of the course is an introductory master-level seminar on empirical research methods in the context of business research. It will focus on different types of research designs and methods, such as lab experiments, field experiments, and survey research. It is meant to help students make informed choices about designing and conducting their own research studies effectively and ethically.

HC analytics focuses on the use of people data for HC decisions and it involves mapping HC initiatives to business outcomes.  The key benefits of employing HC analytics include quantifying returns on HC investments and optimizing employee investments to achieve tangible business outcomes. However, the challenge faced by HC practitioners lies in knowing what to analyze and how to analyze.  Reports have revealed that only a small percentage of HC practitioners are proficient in undertaking advanced univariate analyses and that an even fewer number can perform advanced multivariate analyses.  This proficiency gap suggests a need for HC practitioners to be more competent in this field. The focus of this section of the course is to narrow this gap, allowing HC professionals to play a more strategic role within their organizations through equipping them with the ability to undertake some useful HC analytics on available organizational employee data. The course will use the SPSS software package, chosen for its ease of use and commercial accessibility."
MGMT6008,Innovation Development: Turning Concepts into Business Cases,"This course introduces students to the basic conceptual frameworks and tools for translating  ideas  into business cases and assessing their potential in order to successfully tap into market opportunities with effective go-to-market strategies. Core course components include (i.) creating, articulating and evaluating new innovation ideas and viable (scalable) new venture opportunities, (ii.) estimating demand and market size, (iii.) analyzing and validating business models, and (iv.) concluding the financial potential and risks of new business ideas. To achieve the course objectives, students will engage in group discussions to apply and deepen new knowledge by learning with trial & error, and go through case studies to take into account the processes and experiences of successful firms (and their business cases) in different industries. The students will learn to take the perspectives of entrepreneurs,  intrapreneurs  (agents for innovation in larger organisations) and venture capitalists. The course will be taught in the form of lectures, class exercises and case study discussions."
MGMT6009,Strategic Management,"This course introduces students to the theoretical concepts and analytical tools required for formulating and implementing appropriate strategies that affect the enduring success of the entire organization. Topics covered include external and internal environmental analyses, competitive strategies, corporate strategies, international strategy, merger and acquisitions and strategic alliances. This course emphasizes the application of theory to a number of real world strategic issues. Students are encouraged to synthesize knowledge from other business courses into a comprehensive understanding of firms  competitive advantages."
MGMT6010,Strategic Management,"This course introduces students to the theoretical concepts and analytical tools required for formulating and implementing appropriate strategies that affect the enduring success of the entire organization. Topics covered include external and internal environmental analyses, competitive strategies, corporate strategies, international strategy, merger and acquisitions and strategic alliances. This course emphasizes the application of theory to a number of real world strategic issues. Students are encouraged to synthesize knowledge from other business courses into a comprehensive understanding of firms  competitive advantages."
MGMT6011,Design Thinking and Creative Problem Solving,"This course introduces students to new venture creation and design thinking tools for identifying new and better ways of providing products and services that meet customer expectations. In Part 1, the opportunity recognition process is introduced. We will look at how external factors (context, available resources) and intrinsic factors (motivation, network, risk propensity) interact to create opportunities that an entrepreneur then chooses to seize.

In Part 2, the qualitative design thinking process (based on the IDEO/Stanford Design School process) is introduced (empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test). Applications of design thinking to product and service innovation will be discussed, along with varying of the design contexts, including the private sector, government and social sectors. Participants learn to think like innovators, from the initial idea to managing resources, building partnerships with committed stakeholders and dealing with contingencies. In parallel, participants are encouraged to consider their individual accomplishments and how these might support new venture creation. Participants will work on past accomplishments, chartering the skills, knowledge and abilities that create a unique set of means with which to drive their own innovation projects."
MGMT6012,Capstone Project,"The capstone project is a key component on the participant s educational path within the Master in Innovation programme. Identification of the topic is to be made before the International Residency phase (Babson). Content can be built as the terms progress and students apply what they learn in modules and seminars. The capstone project is a graded requirement of the Masters in Innovation programme, and the topic can be one of the following three broad categories with room for hybridization: a Design Project / Prototype; a Business Plan; or a Practical Innovation Study. The final output of the work is to be presented at the end of the MI programme in front of a group of internal / external Judges, incl. a report."
MGMT6013,Corporate Strategy in a Global Environment,"Generally, strategy is defined as a set of choices that managers make in order to increase their firm s performance relative to competitors. Corporate Strategy in a Global Environment considers strategic choices that managers make in the context of a multi-product, multi-business, multi-location firm. In this course, you will study how successful organizations choose, implement, and evaluate their strategy. The focus will lie on internal and external corporate growth strategies, which have become indispensable for success in today s economic environment marked by increased globalization, rapid technological change, shortened product lifecycles, and enhanced competition. Tools and techniques for strategy formulation, implementation, and evaluation are discussed. Case studies are used to sharpen your understanding of the importance of strategic decision-making.

Specific areas of focus are:
- Corporate Strategy and Competitive Advantage
- Corporate Scope
- Growth through Acquisitions
- Global Strategy and International Expansion
- Sustaining a Successful Enterprise"
MGMT6014,Babson International Residency,"Innovation without entrepreneurship equals zero; innovation with entrepreneurship leads to profit and value creation.  This course will look at the intersection of innovation and entrepreneurship with a particular focus on creating opportunities that have high potential.  Specifically, we ll look at how companies create an innovative culture that leads to growth.  We will also address resource acquisition culminating in a  shark-tank  investor pitch."
MGMT6015,Solving a Human Capital Challenge from Business Perspective,"This course provides an opportunity for participants to examine a key human capital challenge from a business perspective, to systematically review and examine the research that informs us on the challenge, and utilize that information to design and execute a study to examine the different means by which the challenge can be resolved. The applied nature of the report requires a critical evaluative approach, empirical investigation and analysis, and a combination of academic research and business report writing skills."
MGMT6016,Business Acceleration and Growth Strategy,"This module introduces students to core concepts in business acceleration and how these translate to growth in entrepreneurial ventures. We systematically explore how firms grow their business and the challenges they face in doing so. The course includes components from across multiple disciplines of strategy, marketing, finance and human resources to solve daily challenges of growth. This course is designed to help rethink the tenets of core strategy in an entrepreneurial way.

We start the course by discussing what growth is. We examine how companies have embarked on their growth stories and the routes they have chosen. Next, we take a deep dive into business models. What are business models and what makes for a good one? Specifically, we consider what makes a business model scalable by adopting the RTVN (Resources, Transactions, Values, and Narratives) framework. In the second half of the course, we integrate diverse disciplines, considering the roles of human and social capital, governance and operations management and internationalisation in business growth. We conclude with a discussion on sustainability and the new technologies that are driving business innovation."
MGMT6017,Sustainable Impact,"Is your impact upon the planet as a manager, student, or citizenship positive or negative?  Chances are if you are reading this description they are negative.  According to the United Nations people who can afford to attend universities consume the resources of the planet at an unsustainable rate, whether through plane travel, meat consumption, car use, or even how many soybeans we eat.  However as business leaders, managers of people and processes, entrepreneurs, and innovators we are also called upon to address this overconsumption and depletion of our planet s resources and capacity to sustainable us.  This course is the first step in answering that call to leadership.  In this course we will first define our terms.  What do we mean by sustainability?  What do the terms we hear in the discourse of sustainability really stand for - whether it is the triple bottom line, doing good by doing well, systems thinking, or environmental entrepreneurship.  We will then go on to examine cases in the areas of green supply chains, sustainable consumption, green technologies, and alternative ecosystems to begin to inspire ourselves to build and propose solutions that have true sustainable impacts on our planet."
MGMT6018,Internship,"It is an intentional supervised learning related to one's field of study and career goals. Internships can be a very structured learning experience or they can be designed to meet the expectations of the student. Internships can be done locally or overseas. They can be part-time or full-time, paid or unpaid. Internships can be done during the academic year. The one thing all good internship opportunities have in common is they provide students with career-related work experience. Internship is done for a 10 week period."
MGMT6020,Leading Digital Transformation,"Data Science Foundation Course   participants must have completed the assignment for the Data Science foundation course assignment via eLearn before they undertake this course. The submission should be done during the foundation course time frame and submitted via eLearn for the Data Science course. Else, it will be submitted via eLearn for the Leading Digital Transformation course. Specific instructions will be given at the beginning of the course."
MGMT6021,Entrepreneurship and Business Planning,"Have you ever wondered about the road less travelled? Striking it on your own, having more independence and flexibility, and pursuing your own dreams, all while solving problems in the society and creating values and sparks that will inspire others? Do you know that individuals in their 30s, like you, want to start a company the most? Yet most will not do that. Not for fear of failure. Rather, for the lack of the necessary skills and knowledge, preventing them from being able to identify, evaluate, and pursue good entrepreneurial opportunities (Gomulya et al., 2015).  You don t have to start a company tomorrow. However, having basic entrepreneurial skills goes a long way should your personal goals and circumstances ever change. Even for established firms increasingly disrupted by start-ups, having an entrepreneurial mindset is already becoming a necessity rather than an option. Why not seize the opportunity to learn now?

This course aims to help you develop and systematically apply an entrepreneurial way of thinking in a number of ways including: generation of business ideas, and identification of business opportunities to commercialize the ideas. It covers some ongoing management challenges for entrepreneurial ventures and integrates inter-disciplinary knowledge customized by your personal experiences and goals. By combining problem-based learning and hands-on pedagogical approaches, this course encourages creativity and the integration of course readings, real life cases, and student-driven business plans, situated in interactive class and group discussions."
MGMT6022,Managing Innovation and Growth,"Necessity is the mother of invention. One reason for firms to innovate is the necessity to re-invent themselves and get out of stagnation: the industry has either gotten obsolete, or competitors have adopted newer and more efficient business models, and products or services based on more advanced technologies. Innovation is then a necessity as the firm has to innovate or perish, one only has to look at what happened to Blockbuster and Kodak. Blockbuster at one point of time was the leading media rental firm in the world, but they chose to ignore innovation in the way they were delivering their media content to customers. As Netflix gained scale, Blockbuster s inability to innovate meant that their business model was obsolete, and they had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Kodak is another famous example: Steven Sasson at Kodak invented the digital camera way back in the 1970s, but rather than developing and commercializing the innovation, Kodak chose to put the new technology on the backburner, as its commercialization would have meant that their existing business model that relied on chemical printing of photographs would have to be cannibalized. However, other competitors jumped on the bandwagon for competitive advantage: hence, if you do not pursue innovation, your competitors will make you obsolete someday, no product or business model has an eternal shelf life. Innovation has many dimensions: it creates value for existing customers, thereby letting you keep your current market share; it creates value for new customers, enabling you to get growth; it enables you to work with new processes to access a lower cost base; supplier innovation enables you to leverage partners  innovation capabilities to offer value to customers, and capture value for yourself. So the notion of continuous improvement is indeed extendable to continuous innovation, the business world in all sectors moves on a treadmill; the pace of the treadmill is faster in some industries like technology and fashion, and slower in some other industries. Innovation is the lever that enables you to keep pace on the treadmill if you are at the industry average; and enables you to set the pace if you innovate at a faster rate than the industry average. If you stand still on the treadmill or run at a slower pace than the treadmill in a competitive environment, at some stage, you will be thrown off the treadmill.
This course should be of particular interest to people aspiring for a career in designing and managing for innovation, either directly (e.g., V.P. of R&D, R&D Manager) or indirectly (e.g., management consulting). The course will also be useful to SME proprietors and entrepreneurs who intend to serve new markets, or use new technologies, or participants who wish to strategically reposition their offerings in an existing market. The course should also be of interest to people who manage interfaces between innovation and business functions such as finance, marketing, managerial accounting and human resources."
MGMT6024,Internship,"Students may do an internship in a company for 20 weeks. The internship will enable the students to apply and integrate what they have learnt and give them the opportunity to gain real-world working experience in the domain relevant to the MCM programme. Internship is done during the school term. Students will do their internships during the day and attend classes in SMU in the evenings on days when classes are scheduled. Internship may involve payment from company, and the stipend amount is to be agreed between the student and the company."
MGMT6025,New Venture Practicum,"The emergence of successful new ventures, particularly in the digital space, challenged and disrupted traditional industries and businesses in the last decade. Hence, entrepreneurship has become an important area for MBA programs. This practicum provides the SMU MBA students with an opportunity to satisfy their internship requirement via working on developing a business idea for a new venture."
MGMT6026,Entrepreneurship and Intrapreneurship,"Have you ever wondered about creating your own start-up, or creating an entrepreneurial endeavour inside the company you are working for (i.e. being an intra-preneur or a corporate entrepreneur)? These are possibilities that offer more independence and opportunities to pursue your passion, while solving problems in firms and society and creating sparks that will inspire others.

If you feel hesitant, you are not alone. Studies show that many individuals are unsure about being an entrepreneur. Not for fear of failure. Rather, for the lack of the necessary skills and knowledge, preventing them from being able to identify, evaluate, and pursue good entrepreneurial opportunities (Gomulya et al., 2015).  You don t have to start a company tomorrow. However, having basic entrepreneurial skills goes a long way should your personal goals and circumstances ever change. These days, an entrepreneurial mindset is already becoming a necessity rather than an option, both in start-ups and established firms. Why not seize the opportunity to learn now?

This course aims to help you instil and apply an entrepreneurial mindset in the context of business planning. We will achieve this through a number of ways including: generation of business ideas, and identification of business opportunities to commercialize the ideas. This course covers some ongoing management challenges for entrepreneurial ventures and integrates inter-disciplinary knowledge customized by your personal experiences and goals. By combining problem-based learning and hands-on pedagogical approaches, this course encourages creativity and the integration of course readings, real life cases, and student-driven business plans, situated in interactive class and group discussions."
MGMT6027,Communicating Across Cultures,"The competencies to communicate cross-culturally well are indispensable in this age of globalisation.  The course provides strategies on how to read a person s as well as corporate culture.  Features of culture such as individualism/collectivism, power distance, masculinity/femininity, and issues related to intercultural adaptation, ethnocentrism, prejudice, stereotyping and racism will be discussed.  The aim of this course is to develop intercultural competencies, which will make business practices more meaningful and significant."
MGMT6028,Business Analytics Foundations,"Organizations need to exploit their business data using data analytics to gain better insights and take more effective actions. In this course,  students will learn what is data analytics and understand the different levels of analytics to solve different types of business problems. The course will emphasize on asking the right questions for the identified problems, and getting the data to answer the questions. Data analytics applications from various industries will be shared to expose students to different questions, different settings, and different solutions. Students will learn two tools, Weka for predictive analytics, and QlikSense for data visualization. At the end of the course, the students will prepare a QlikSense dashboard to visualize a data set of their choice to answer relevant business questions."
MGMT6029,"Opportunity Recognition, Ideation and Innovation Management","This course introduces the student to  the front end of innovation . We will explore the theory and will practice Design Thinking, we will also apply the techniques and principles of design thinking through a project that will step through the ideation and opportunity recognition  front end  of innovation. Design Thinking and the tools that support it are a powerful process that can improve product, service and experience concepts (selected applications to products and services will be covered).

In Part 1, the design thinking process (based on the IDEO/Stanford Design School process) is introduced. This is a qualitative process consisting of the stages of: the observation of users, ideation, and prototyping. Iteration can occur between any steps, and multiple cycles are typical. Applications of design thinking to product and service innovation will be discussed, along with varying of the design contexts, including the private sector, government and social sectors. Design thinking will be framed against traditional innovation processes and other types of thinking.

In Part 2, the course will cover theories of innovation management and how to make organizations more innovative."
MGMT6030,Leading Business Transformation,"Digital technologies have virtually disrupted every industry and caused permanent changes to the way we work and live. Although many businesses have benefited from the new technology, more of them are being threatened or have been displaced by it. From now, digital technology will only proliferate at an exponential rate and businesses who cannot harness such capabilities will experience an accelerated erosion of their competitive advantages in productivity, product and service offerings, staff quality, consumer loyalty, and many other areas. Despite the urgent need for digital transformation, many businesses have slid into what Gartner documented as the  Trough of Disillusionment . Many explanatory factors were offered and most centred around the confusion of what digital transformation actually entails.

We define digital transformation as a movement centred around a digital-first thinking, as opposed to the misconceived technology-first or digital improvement approaches. A digital-first approach starts with a thorough understanding of the new paradigms of business strategy made possible by digital technologies, followed by a working understanding of the technologies involved, and most importantly, the organizational structure, teamwork, and culture that are necessary to support such endeavours. Digital transformation is not a patchwork of modular improvements designed for plug-and-play. It is a top-down, holistic, enlightened, determined, and dynamic (agile) movement aimed at persisting business performance.

In this course, students will be given the opportunity to master digital-first thinking via our three prong approach. We start with the inculcation of new digital drivers of disruptive businesses through frameworks, toolkits, and discussions. Following which, we introduce the essential building blocks of digital-first thinking to transform business value propositions, improve decision making, optimize organizational structures and processes, and create a new working culture that is needed for a digital-first organisation. In the third part, we will attempt to synergize what we have learned and collectively create strategies and roadmaps for existing and new industries of the future."
MGMT6031,Business Analytics,"Business Analytics involves designing, collecting, analyzing and presenting data-driven decisions using various approaches like statistical models, data mining techniques, simulations and tools. Organizations and business managers are increasingly utilizing data to assess the return on their investments, better understand their customers and improve their decision-making. Availability of large amounts of data, both structured and unstructured, has further increased the need to understand and extract all the relevant information from these data.
In three days of the business analytics course, we will start from the basic idea about what is business analytics. We will delve into different types of analytics like descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics, different types of data, structured and unstructured, and different types of analysis and tools. As such, we will use developments in statistical science to examine solutions to important issues faced in business analytics. There will be various cases and readings provided and used in the class to demonstrate the importance of data-driven decision making. Specifically, we will discuss regression, measuring online impact, machine learning techniques, conducting field experiments, and innovation in retail and digital analytics. The main emphasis of this course is on understanding, interpreting and proper use of various research techniques and providing executives with important quantitative acumen for appreciating business analytics."
MGMT6032,Negotiating in Business,"We negotiate every day. We negotiate with potential employers, co-workers, roommates, landlords, parents, bosses, merchants, service providers, spouses, and even our children. What price we want to pay, how much we want to be paid, who will do the dishes...all of these are negotiations. Yet, although people negotiate all the time, most know very little about the strategy and psychology of effective negotiations. Why do we sometimes get our way whereas other times we walk away feeling frustrated by our inability to obtain the agreement we desire?

Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more interdependent parties. This course is designed to be relevant to a broad spectrum of negotiation problems that are faced by managers and professionals. It is also designed to complement the technical and diagnostic skills that are learned in other courses at the SMU. A basic premise of this course is that while managers need analytical skills to develop optimal solutions to problems, they also require a broad array of negotiation skills for these solutions to be accepted and implemented. Successful completion of this course will enable you to recognize, understand, and analyse essential concepts in negotiations."
MGMT6033,Creativity as Precursor to Innovation,"The terms  innovation  and  creativity  are often used interchangeably. However, they are actually distinct. Creativity is the production of novel and useful ideas whereas innovation is the successful implementation of these creative ideas. In this course, our focus is on understanding creativity as a precursor to innovation. We will examine the key drivers and challenges of creative thinking in the organizational context. This course will contain a mix of real-world case studies and discussion of classic and emerging research on creativity to help student foster a basic understanding of the vast and growing field of creativity."
MGMT6034,Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility,"In this day and age, it is no longer sufficient for managers and leaders in organizations to be simply transactional or simply transformational. They also need to be fair, just, ethical, moral and responsible. The same might be said for organizations themselves.  It is not enough for organizations to be profitable they must also behave responsibly and sustainably. This course is divided into two sections that cover (1) what it means be ethical in an organizational setting and (2) the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and its role in business and society.

The Ethics portion of the course is designed to explore, inform, and stimulate thinking on issues related to behavioural ethics and responsibility as encountered in the corporate world. To create this intellectual exchange, this course will focus on how individual and organizational behaviour is shaped by context as well as by biases, why these factors make it difficult for managers to be responsible leaders, and what can be done about the influence of these factors. It is important to emphasize that the goal of this course is not the ethical or moral transformation of students but to develop a set of tools and frameworks (where possible) that allow us to manage effectively in a world increasingly characterized by stakeholders with competing needs and responsibilities.

In the CSR portion of this course we explore the idea that businesses bear a responsibility to society and a broader set of stakeholders beyond their shareholders.  An idea that has gained currency since the 1970s. The question remains however whether corporations have a responsibility towards and within society that goes beyond merely being well run companies? Through this course, we will engage in a critical evaluation and discussion of different views on the meaning of CSR and the  proper  role of CSR in business and society. We will also discuss contemporary research and organizational practices that inform the integration of CSR within a firm s core business strategy and operations. We will understand that through strategically managed CSR, including ways to create shared value and apply sustainable business strategies, business corporations can potentially identify business opportunities that help address the world s most pressing challenges and manage relationships with important stakeholders who affect the firm s sustained success."

MGMT6037,Internship,"Students may do an internship in a company for a minimal of 10 weeks. The internship will enable the students to apply and integrate what they have learnt and give them the opportunity to gain real-world working experience in the domain relevant to the programme. Internship is done during the school term. Students will do their internships during the day and attend classes in SMU in the evenings on days when classes are scheduled. Internship may involve payment from company, and the stipend amount is to be agreed between the student and the company."
MGMT6038,Data Visualization and Communication,"Future HR professionals must be able to explain HR issues in business language to help in making people decisions. No professional in the field can expect to succeed in his or her career without the ability to build a solid business case, built on evidence, insights and a compelling story.

To implement their organisation s strategies effectively, it is imperative that HR provide data-driven answers and insights on how to implement and execute strategy through the people in the organization. The organisations that will win the  war for talent  will be those which are better at identifying and keeping key talent, motivating high performance, developing and promoting staff and accurately predicting future people needs. HR professionals need to persuade business leaders of the need for HR interventions and practices to address these challenges.

This programme provides participants with practical, hands-on approaches to connect HR policies and practices to business performance. Working with accessible tools such as Excel, we will practice building descriptive and predictive models, review the key tenets of building business cases and crafting a compelling story using simple yet effective data visualization techniques. The course will allow you to get hands-on experience in approaches for workforce planning, recruitment, compensation, training, employee engagement, career planning and turnover. We will also do practical exercises in class involving  real  data. At the end of the course, you will be able to put these skills and tools to good use.

The course also includes a visit to a local company to review how they do HR Analytics, the HR Operations that supports it, and how the data is put to use to address business problems."
MGMT6039,Qualitative Research Methods for HR Professionals,"The purpose of this course is to help you better understand qualitative research methods so as to enable you to be a better researcher and reader of work that employs these types of methodologies. Given the breadth and variety of methods that fall under the rubric of  qualitative methods,  all classes will discuss general issues or skills that are applicable to several different methodological approaches.  You will notice that there is not a separate week on ethics.  Ethical treatment of those we study is crucial to all methodologies (quantitative and qualitative)   but ethical issues can be particularly acute in some forms of qualitative research.  As a result, we will integrate discussions of ethics throughout the course, and not relegate it to a weekly topic of discussion.

Qualitative methods courses in business schools are relatively rare. Ask most users of qualitative methods and they will talk about being trained using the apprenticeship model only. Taken together, this is both an exciting challenge and a daunting one   as there are few templates for such a course.  Consequently, your input will be essential in helping me refine and redesign the course as we go along. Thus, unlike other methods courses where you are  served  information, this course will be more like a  pot luck  with you bringing things to the class every week!

There will be many avenues for learning in this class: Each week we will read and discuss what academic scholars and researchers have written about a specific topic.  During the course, you will also do research on a specific methodology not covered in class. These will be the most  traditional  parts of class. Furthermore, in this course, I will give you a  hands on  experience and the opportunity to explore and experiment with some of the data collection and data analyses strategies.

To close, this course will be a lot of work -- but I also hope that it will also be enriching and fun!  By the time we are finished, you should have begun developing a unique skill set that should serve you well at work."

MGMT6042,Business Analytics,"This course is designed to meet the increasing needs of industry and recruiters in applying quantitative and analytical skills for understanding consumer decision-making. Business managers utilize marketing data to assess the return on their investments and better understand their customers. The course provides students with an opportunity to analyse real-world marketing problems.
The best way to learn all the material in this course is through  hands-on  experience. As such, we will use developments in statistical science to examine solutions to important issues faced in business analytics. There will be various datasets and tools provided and used in the class to get practical experience. Specifically, we will discuss market and customer segmentation techniques, regression and choice modelling, economic models of pricing, retail and web analytics. The emphasis being on understanding, interpreting and proper use of these research techniques. The primary aim of this course is to learn new skills and tools that will provide students with important quantitative acumen for understanding business analytics."
MGMT6043,Design Thinking for Opportunity Recognition and Innovation,"This practical and immersive course introduces the student to the key tenets of design thinking for creating new products and services. Through a project, they will learn how to apply design thinking for opportunity recognition, creative problem solving and concepts validation.

They will learn the various user research and sense making methods used in the design thinking process to uncover consumers  unmet needs, wants and desires, and prioritize insights for innovation opportunities. They will also learn key creative methods to explore ideas as well as techniques to test and validate ideas with users.

This course will use the Stanford Design School s five steps and the UK Design Council Double Diamond process as the design thinking framework."
MGMT6044,Innovation Management,"Necessity is the mother of invention. One reason for firms to innovate is the necessity to re-invent themselves and get out of stagnation: the industry has either gotten obsolete, or competitors have adopted newer and more efficient business models, and products or services based on more advanced technologies. Innovation is then a necessity as the firm has to innovate or perish, one only has to look at what happened to Blockbuster and Kodak. Blockbuster at one point of time was the leading media rental firm in the world, but they chose to ignore innovation in the way they were delivering their media content to customers. As Netflix gained scale, Blockbuster s inability to innovate meant that their business model was obsolete, and they had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Kodak is another famous example: Steven Sasson at Kodak invented the digital camera way back in the 1970s, but rather than developing and commercializing the innovation, Kodak chose to put the new technology on the backburner, as its commercialization would have meant that their existing business model that relied on chemical printing of photographs would have to be cannibalized. However, other competitors jumped on the bandwagon for competitive advantage: hence, if you do not pursue innovation, your competitors will make you obsolete someday, no product or business model has an eternal shelf life. Innovation has many dimensions: it creates value for existing customers, thereby letting you keep your current market share; it creates value for new customers, enabling you to get growth; it enables you to work with new processes to access a lower cost base; supplier innovation enables you to leverage partners  innovation capabilities to offer value to customers, and capture value for yourself. So the notion of continuous improvement is indeed extendable to continuous innovation, the business world in all sectors moves on a treadmill; the pace of the treadmill is faster in some industries like technology and fashion, and slower in some other industries. Innovation is the lever that enables you to keep pace on the treadmill if you are at the industry average; and enables you to set the pace if you innovate at a faster rate than the industry average. If you stand still on the treadmill or run at a slower pace than the treadmill in a competitive environment, at some stage, you will be thrown off the treadmill.

This course should be of particular interest to people aspiring for a career in designing and managing for innovation, either directly (e.g., V.P. of R&D, R&D Manager) or indirectly (e.g., management consulting). The course will also be useful to SME proprietors and entrepreneurs who intend to serve new markets, or use new technologies, or participants who wish to strategically reposition their offerings in an existing market. The course should also be of interest to people who manage interfaces between innovation and business functions such as finance, marketing, managerial accounting and human resources. This course introduces the student to  the front end of innovation . We will explore the practice of innovation, and we will also apply the techniques and principles of innovation that will step through the ideation and opportunity recognition  front end  of innovation. The tools that support it are a powerful process that can improve product, service and experience concepts (selected applications to products and services will be covered). The course will cover theories of innovation management and how to make organizations more innovative. We will introduce participants to the concept of Creativity being the front end of innovation. The theoretical background that we will use for Creativity will be the Innovator s Method Model by Furr and Dyer, the Innovator s DNA model created by Dyer, Gregersen and  Christensen, and the ideas of creativity enhancement challenges by IDEO and taught by the Stanford Design School. We will first elicit definitions of creativity and innovation from the participants, followed by a number of interactive exercises for enhancing creativity that were designed by IDEO. Overall, we will have interactive exercises and tools for most of the sessions, all the creativity challenges are tools for enhancing creativity, as shown by the Stanford Design School. They key message will be the correspondence between creativity and divergent thinking. We will show that the creativity aspect of individuals in hindered by various cognitive biases, we will define and explore these biases.

Managing innovation and growth is challenging, as innovation can be driven by multiple facets. Business innovation can be classified into three kinds: (i) innovation of the core products and services that are offered to customers, called product or service innovation. This is the most commonly understood kind of innovation, the firm can either create improved variants of existing products and services, giving them a competitive advantage in the current industry scenario; or it can create radically new products and services that create new markets. The Apple iMac comes out with new variants all the time that are faster and lighter, this would be an example of an innovation that gives you a competitive advantage in an existing market. The iPad created a new market, in that it was somewhere between a mobile phone and a laptop, the phablet would be an example of a product that created a new market. (ii) innovations in the design of the supply chain enable the firm to lower its cost base, leverage the innovative capabilities of its suppliers, and get its products and services to your customers faster and at lower cost. Toyota s well-known Keiretsu model is a good example of process or supply chain innovation, that lowers the cost of delivery, and improves service levels simultaneously. Finally, (iii) innovations at the interface of the firm with their suppliers and consumers enables customers to provide more value to their customers, and capture more value for themselves, by matching supply and demand better. Zara s famed agile model, where they design and produce small batches to understand customer preferences and then scale production of bestsellers has enabled them to get a significant market and cost advantage, Zara is the world s biggest apparel seller today. This course has a large emphasis on hands-on learning, using simulations and classroom exercises to give the participant a better idea of advancements in innovations and growth. The course gives the participant an overview of the issues of innovation and growth management in a wide variety of industries, including digital businesses.  After completing the course, the student should be able to characterize the innovation and growth issues in an industry/firm, evaluate current practice and identify improvement opportunities for making innovation sustainable using resources on a global scale."
MGMT6045,Strategy,"This course introduces students to the theoretical concepts and analytical tools required for formulating and implementing appropriate strategies that affect the enduring success of the entire organization. Topics covered include external and internal environmental analyses, business-level strategies, corporate-level strategies, and innovation strategies. This course emphasizes the application of theory to a number of real world cases. Students are encouraged to synthesize knowledge from other business courses into a comprehensive understanding of firms  competitive advantages."
MGMT6046,Design Thinking,"Design Thinking is an open-ended, open-minded, and iterative approach to finding solutions for difficult business problems. It uses technology and a designer s toolkit, while focusing on human needs. You don t need to be a designer to become a design thinker. This course is your opportunity to learn to apply creative and collaborative tools, such as brainstorming and prototypes, to real-life challenges. As we discuss design thinking case studies at many Fortune 500 companies, you will be first introduced (in the form of interactive lectures) then practice (through hands-on workshops) the design thinking process. Designs go through many iterations and you will also refine your project multiple times. By staying human-centered, you too can learn to communicate with creative confidence knowing that while your solution may not be perfect, it optimally meets the needs of the people you are designing for."
MGMT6047,Executive Conversation Series,"This course provides students with business investigation and practical opportunities. Through company visits, students are expected to understand the business models and latest developments in the industry, as well as the relationship between finance and business and other practical issues. The course emphasizes students' practical ability and insights into corporate financial management and strategy."
MGMT6048,Internship,"An internship experience provides students with an opportunity to gain first-hand exposure to working in the real world. It enables student to explore career interests while applying knowledge and skills learned in the classroom to a work setting. The experience also helps students gain a clearer sense of the skills they need to learn and provides an opportunity to build professional networks. Past experience has shown that an internship will significantly increase the likelihood of permanent job offers.
Students can choose to take up a part-time internship assignment or full-time internship assignment by clocking at least 400 hours to qualify for a 1-course unit. Part-time students and students with three-year relevant working experience and above will be exempted from the internship graduation requirement."

MGMT6050,Internship,"Students may do an internship in a company for 10 weeks. The internship is extendable for another 18 weeks. The internship will enable the students to apply and integrate what they have learnt and give them the opportunity to gain real-world working experience in the domain relevant to the MAF programme. Internship may involve payment from company, and the stipend amount is to be agreed between the student and the company."
MGMT6051,Doing Business in Asia,"The 48 countries and 3 territories that comprise Asia are each individually and comparatively highly distinct and diverse from each other   more so than any other broad region of the world. While founded as civilisations, the subsequent influences of transcontinental trade carried with it a diversity of cultures, languages, religions, colonialism, industrialisation, nation-state conceptualisations, inter-regional and global wars, state revolutions, and alternative forms of capitalisms - thereby creating a kaleidoscope of markets for businesses to navigate in the region. Japan, China, and India represent the historical nexus in Asia, each having their own challenges for foreign businesses to penetrate. But what has been gaining the attention of business has been the emergence of the ASEAN region   an opportunity represented by over 600 million people, a population greater than Europe, which will become the fourth largest economy in the world by 2030. Comprising Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos, Singapore, and Brunei (ordered by population size), ASEAN is the fourth largest export trading region in the world. However, economic development across ASEAN is extremely diverse with the spread of per capita income being a factor 24x between the richest country, Singapore, versus the poorest, Cambodia.

This course will equip the student with an appreciation of the historical influences on the social-political-economic structures of the countries within Asia, with an emphasis on ASEAN. Similar to the analogy that it is better for sustained survival to teach someone how to fish rather than give them fish, this course will provide students with the tools to understand how to internationalise within Asia. Students will learn to conceptualise the different forms of capitalisms that are practiced across these markets, identifying implications for the business model of the multinational. As a manager of a multinational, or a local family business beginning to expand beyond the home market to become a multinational, the student will also learn about the role of, and interrelations, among the corporate headquarters, regional office, and foreign country subsidiaries, as they attempt to penetrate the markets within their selected foreign countries, and manage the enterprise."
MGMT6052,Business Acceleration and Growth Strategy,"This module introduces students to core concepts in business acceleration and how these translate to growth in entrepreneurial ventures. We systematically explore how firms grow their business and the challenges they face in doing so. The course includes components from across multiple disciplines of strategy, marketing, finance and human resources to solve daily challenges of growth. This course is designed to help rethink the tenets of core strategy in an entrepreneurial way.

We start the course by discussing what growth is. We examine how companies have embarked on their growth stories and the routes they have chosen. Next, we take a deep dive into business models. What are business models and what makes for a good one? Specifically, we consider what makes a business model scalable by adopting the RTVN (Resources, Transactions, Values, and Narratives) framework. In the second half of the course, we integrate diverse disciplines, considering the roles of human and social capital, governance and operations management and internationalisation in business growth. We conclude with a discussion on sustainability and the new technologies that are driving business innovation."
MGMT6053,Management Studies,"A good MBA curriculum provides an opportunity for students to apply what they learnt from the classroom. For FT MBA students, internship provides an opportunity to engage in such activities. For PT MBA students, the Management Studies project allow them to work on a project with their organization or some other organization that are willing to sponsor their project."
MGMT6054,Human Capital and Business Strategy,"This introductory course is designed to provide a broad overview of critical dimensions of human capital in the context of business strategy. Business leaders and managers must understand the context of the organizational environment and make decisions related to human capital. Starting with the origins of the concept of human capital, we explore the direct and indirect influences of organization structure, strategic leadership, organization culture, and talent management on human capital as a resource of the firm. We will provide a common grounding in each of the topics through practice perspectives and bring these to life with case studies along with student sharing. To help bridge the link to academic research, we will also anchor to key points in the literature."
MGMT6055,Business Analytics,"Business Analytics involves designing, collecting, analyzing and presenting data-driven decisions using various approaches like statistical models, data mining techniques, simulations and tools. Organizations and business managers are increasingly utilizing data to assess the return on their investments, better understand their customers and improve their decision-making. Availability of large amounts of data, both structured and unstructured, has further increased the need to understand and extract all the relevant information from these data. The content of this course is based on cutting-edge research in both academic and practitioner communities. The course provides students with an opportunity to analyze real-world business problems.

The best way to learn all the material in this course is through  hands-on  experience. As such, we will use recent developments in statistical science to examine solutions to important issues faced in business research. There will be various datasets and tools provided and used in the class to get practical experience about Business Analytics. Specifically, we will discuss different types of analytics, basic statistics, market and segmentation techniques, regression and classification modeling, machine learning techniques, and digital analytics. The emphasis being on understanding, interpretation and proper use of various business research techniques. One of the goals of this course is to train knowledgeable managers who can evaluate the quality of the research and utilize the information to effectively make strategic decisions. The primary aim of this course is to learn new skills and tools that will provide students with important quantitative acumen for success in an analytics career."
MGMT6056,Strategic Management,"EMBA students have risen through the ranks of their organizations and they are typically increasingly involved in formulating and implementing strategies that place their organizations in advantageous positions relative to a global set of competitors. This course will enhance your career opportunities by strengthening your ability to evaluate, select, and implement, a number of key strategic choices.

This course is a blend of theory and practice and designed to provide tools and techniques for strategy formulation, implementation, and evaluation to help senior managers make better informed and more optimal strategic decisions. Specifically, the focus of the course is on (a) external (e.g., the competitive environment) and internal (e.g., the resources and capabilities that organizations can leverage for competitive advantage) factors that influence companies  performance, (b) how companies can better position themselves relative to rivals, (c) how companies can create value by expanding (i.e. vertical integration) or reducing (i.e. outsourcing) their vertical scope, (d) how companies can improve their competiveness through industry and geographic diversification, and (e) how external corporate development activities such as M&As and alliance can help companies achieve their strategic goals."
MGMT6058,Human Capital and Global Business Strategy,"This elective course is designed to provide a broad overview of critical dimensions of human capital necessary to execute business strategy. Business leaders must not only understand strategy, but also how the context of the organizational environment affects strategy execution. Too often, business leaders fail to make the linkages between human capital decisions and strategic management. Starting with the alignment of strategy to firm resources, we explore the direct and indirect influences of organization structure, strategic leadership, organization culture, and talent management on human capital as a resource of the firm. We will provide a common grounding in each of the topics through practice perspectives, academic research, and application with case studies along with student sharing. To further consider the contextual nature of human capital, we will take a global view highlighting different countries each session."

MGMT6061,Design Thinking,"Design Innovation (DI) is a design thinking program that helps organizations use design as a tool for strategic impact and organizational transformation. It is a human-centered design approach that starts with a focus on what the user and organization really need and want. You don t need to be a designer to use DI, but if you want your company to be amongst - what a 2018 McKinsey report called - top quartile design index performers  that outperform their industry benchmarks 32% on revenue and 56% on total returns to shareholders, then come along this learning experience. The intensive three-day course will guide you through a customized DI journey that integrates design thinking, business design, design engineering, and systems engineering.

This year, the SMU LKCSB EMBA program has a special joint collaboration with the Masters in Innovation by Design Programme at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). SMU and SUTD students will work together in small project groups with diverse technology and business backgrounds to design solutions for real-world problems."
MGMT6062,Sustainability & Business Opportunities in Southeast Asia,"Concepts of Sustainability in business management. The process of establishing sustainable precepts to the organization.

Change management with resilient and systemic thinking, including key skills of 20th century   i.e., Design Thinking; Innovative Thinking. Analysis of problems and factors affecting normal (BAU) business versus business that is sustainability-conscious."
MGMT6063,Future of Cities,"  A quoted definition of sustainable development is that of the Brundtland Commission of the United Nations:  sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs .

  Climate change, resource scarcity, world population growth and rapid urbanization have created unprecedented pressure on cities and a key challenge for a sustainable development and quality of life.

  While there were just ten megacities (population over ten million) in 1990, in 2014 the number reached 28. In 2008, for the first time, more people lived in urban areas than rural areas. In 1950, 30 per cent of the world s population was urban, and by 2050, 66 per cent of the world s population is projected to be urban (based on the forecast of 9 billion people). In this scenario, the UN projects that humans will consolidate into 41 megacity regions by 2030.

  Indeed, these challenges create a multitude of opportunities for business who have the chance to offer innovative solutions for our future. Of course, the complexity of the problem calls for a systemic approach based on new technologies, new business models, new approaches to planning, financing and policy making.

  This module will address the topic of the future of cities by focusing on forecasts, experts  opinions, case studies and industry insights.

  Since this module is a Glocal Elective, the topics will be discussed from a global perspective.

  The application, execution and transformation of  smart cities  will focus on Singapore as a global best practice exemplar."
MGMT6064,"Sustainable Development in ASEAN - Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia","This course will be an immersive learning experience with company and other visits followed by debriefings. Participants will visit Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Johor in Malaysia, and Kerinci, Sumatra in Indonesia. Among the issues speakers will cover are:
  Corporate strategy:  comparative/competitive advantage, emerging vs. established MNCs
  Government strategy:  domestic political views on economic development, regional alliances, inter-governmental organizations
  Urbanization:  movement of people from the land to cities, need for and financing of housing and infrastructure
  Environment and natural resources:   extraction and removal, re-planting, environmentally sensitive practices
  Stakeholders: governments, workers/unions, foreign investors, suppliers, customers, and NGOs
  Human capital:   skill level of the labor force, decent work challenges in low wage industries, upgrading skills and developing talent"
MGMT6065,Leadership Lab,"Leadership Lab is conceived as a practical application of leadership theories and approaches gained from OBHR605 (Leading in a Global Environment) and OBHR633 (Human Capital) by EMBA participants. A critical deficiency seen in current business is the absence of time to practice newly learnt skills on the job. Concomitantly, learners rarely practice newly learnt skills whether this is because of a lack of opportunity, a fear of failure or avoidance of embarrassment in team situations. Compounding this leadership challenge is the added hurdle of virtual / hybrid leadership engagement.  How does the new hybrid real-virtual environment affect leadership and how can we practice leadership in this new environment? This module will provide opportunities to practice and reflect on leadership performance in real life and virtually to enable preparation for real-life application."
MGMT6066,Doing Business in Asia,"The 48 countries and 3 territories that comprise Asia are each individually and comparatively highly distinct and diverse from each other   more so than any other broad region of the world.

The course qualifies for one credit unit and encompasses seminars in Singapore, culminating in a study trip at end of semester. Grading is on a Pass/Fail basis."
MGMT6071,ESG and Sustainability in Business Families,"Family firms are ubiquitous in many economies. Half of the 30 largest firms in 27 developed economies are family-owned. In the S&P 500, 40% are family firms. In the Asia Pacific, family firms are estimated to comprise 85% of commercial businesses.

Since family owners usually have long-standing ties with local communities, family firms are also strong proponents of community impact and local causes. As wealth owners, family members also have the potential to deploy private capital in commercial investments, as well as towards broader causes in the philanthropic and impact space. Business families thus play a critical role in the sustainability agenda through their operating businesses as well as in their private capacity.

Family firms differ from the typical MNC in terms of their links to the family s legacy, values, organizational structure, processes, and dynamics. Thus, a different set of management tools and frameworks are required to lead family firms and to advise family owners in their approach to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concerns.

This course is structured around 3 themes with a focus on Asian family firms: 1) Sustainable family business, 2) Environmental and social impact, 3) Governance and succession. Through case studies, guest speakers, and interactive discussions, the course will equip students with the conceptual frameworks to a) understand the dynamics of family-ownership in Asia, and b) apply the structures, tools, and techniques to enable next-gen leaders and advisors to family firms in the pursuit of sustainability goals."
MGMT6072,VBE1 Entrepreneurial Mindset,"This course traces the steps that entrepreneurs likely encounter between a first recognition of a potential business opportunity to the nascent operation of the actual company.  This course teaches students the basic ingredients of a business plan and a short  pitch  for their ideas, yet shows the limitations of a static document in the changing marketplace.  Through the use of real business cases, this course helps students understand various issues that require analysis and resolution before their company can be on a more financially sustainable footing."
MGMT6073,VBE2 Managing Teams,"Organizations are increasingly relying on and looking to venture builders as a new growth priority and innovation strategy. This course examines the design and management of venture building with a specific focus on the processes of identifying business ideas, building high-quality teams, raising capital, managing the venture and providing shared services. This course is designed to provide you with perspectives and skills that will help you to develop and manage high impact venture building teams by understanding the interpersonal dynamics and structural characteristics that influence the effectiveness of teams as well as sharing of knowledge and information in teams. Topics include understanding the foundations of high performing teams, communication and managing team conflict."
MGMT6074,VBE3 Minimum Viable Product,"This course is distilled from best practices around the world on venture building (e.g., Creative Destruction Lab model) to focus on pushing students to set agenda to meet and deliver on it. The main implementation of this revolves around having students present their ideas and goals every time we meet to mentors and fellow classmates, update what they have done from the past meeting, and set agenda for the next meeting. Mentors will guide students to ensure that students continue to make good progress."

MGMT6077,Business Ethics,"In this day and age, it is not enough for organizations to be profitable, they must also behave responsibly and sustainably. The same might be said for managers and leaders in organizations. It is no longer sufficient for them to be simply transactional or simply transformational. They also need to be fair, just, ethical, moral and responsible.

This course is designed to explore, inform, and stimulate thinking on issues related to behavioural ethics and responsibility as encountered in the corporate world. To create this intellectual exchange, this course will focus on how individual and organizational behaviour is shaped by context as well as by biases, why these factors make it difficult for managers to be responsible leaders, and what can be done about the influence of these factors. It is important to emphasize that the goal of this course is not the ethical or moral transformation of students but to develop a set of tools and frameworks (where possible) that allow us to manage effectively in a world increasingly characterized by stakeholders with competing needs and responsibilities."

MGMT6081,Future of Cities,"  A quoted definition of sustainable development is that of the Brundtland Commission of the United Nations:  sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs .

  Climate change, resource scarcity, world population growth and rapid urbanization have created unprecedented pressure on cities and a key challenge for a sustainable development and quality of life.

  While there were just ten megacities (population over ten million) in 1990, in 2014 the number reached 28. In 2008, for the first time, more people lived in urban areas than rural areas. In 1950, 30 per cent of the world s population was urban, and by 2050, 66 per cent of the world s population is projected to be urban (based on the forecast of 9 billion people). In this scenario, the UN projects that humans will consolidate into 41 megacity regions by 2030.

  Indeed, these challenges create a multitude of opportunities for business who have the chance to offer innovative solutions for our future. Of course, the complexity of the problem calls for a systemic approach based on new technologies, new business models, new approaches to planning, financing and policy making.

  This module will address the topic of the future of cities by focusing on forecasts, experts  opinions, case studies and industry insights.

  Since this module is a Glocal Elective, the topics will be discussed from a global perspective.

MKTG101,Marketing,"The course introduces Marketing as both a professional and an academic discipline.  As a profession, marketers identify consumer needs, determine which target markets to serve, and develop an optimal product, pricing, promotion, and distribution strategy that best satisfy consumer needs, relative to competition. These decisions product, price, promotion, and distribution flow from a rigorous analysis of the constantly evolving market environment and consumer needs (for example, the recent rise of ethical, sustainable, and socially responsible consumption). Marketers serve a vital role in the long-term success of all organizations, profit-oriented as well as not-for-profit, small as well as large.

In most economies, services account for more than 50% of the economy. This course is designed for undergraduates seeking to develop a deeper understanding of services. Strategies used by successful services marketers to overcome problems unique to service industries like banking, health care, financial services, insurance, hospitality, consulting, telecom, media, and IT services will be discussed.

MKTG205,Advertising,"Advertising has been a powerful marketing tool deployed around the world for decades by companies and organizations of all sizes and types.

MKTG214,Technology Marketing,"This course focuses on the marketing of technology companies and their products or services. As I have often told past students in my marketing courses, get comfortable with ambiguity . Marketing success is rarely the result of a single inalterable, formulaic strategic plan. Instead, the best marketers understand that customers do not behave rationally and that even the best plans are constantly fine-tuned. Most importantly, great marketing provides a framework that creates a bias for action , not a bias for never-ending analysis and planning. Results only come when you actually try something, not think about trying something."

MKTG219,Marketing Channels and New Retail,"A significant domain of the study of marketing covers the roles of the Marketing Channels. It is the set of integrated business activities that must occur before products and services are made available to final consumers. This course will cover the concepts of channel functions comprising the supply side of designing routes to markets. The scope of this course covers both the business-to-business aspect of trade channel marketing as well as the business-to-consumer marketing now referred to as the  new retail.  The digital transformation of marketing is studied in relation to both its impact on channel marketing as well as consumer shopping behaviours. Marketing channels have recently been put into greater focus because of the challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the recent shocks on the supply chain created by political and economic uncertainties. The critical component of value creation for customers in marketing that is often overlooked is how customers want to buy. Therefore, the ability to make its products and services available to customers at the right place and time is a key source of creating customer value and competitive advantages for the marketing organization. Learning in this course will be supplemented through case studies of marketing channels in different product categories as well as industry expert talks."
MKTG225,Customer Relationship Management,"Customer relationship management (CRM) is an important development within the field of marketing.

Students are evaluated on individual assignments, group projects, class participation and term papers."
MKTG227,Integrated Marketing Communications: A Brand Perspective,"Marketing communications in the context of contemporary marketing has gone beyond the realm of the traditional tools of communications often classified as promotions. While advertising, public relations, sales promotions and personal selling remain the essence of the promotions mix, the intention of this course is to show how these tools are integrated not just within the promotions mix but also beyond the other elements of the marketing mix. The popular mantra applies here:  all elements of the marketing mix have the capacity to communicate.  Major changes primarily impacted by the use of the digital media as well as the global impact of messaging in marketing needs to be strongly factored in today s study of marketing communications. Ultimately, the end outcome of IMC is its impact on the brand in terms of its ability to elevate brand awareness, brand recognition and ultimately brand preference and loyalty. In all aspects of the topics covered in this course, the focus would be on the connection between marketing communications and branding and how IMC can help organizations build long-term brand equity."
MKTG228,Marketing Analytics,"The field of marketing is becoming increasingly data-oriented with firms building and growing their marketing analytics capabilities.

MKTG234,Sustainable Marketing,"Much of marketing in the last half century has been about the single-minded satisfaction of consumer needs and wants. The key to success is thought to lie in thoroughly understanding what these needs and wants are and ensuring the best fit between what is offered as a product and what is desired. This market-led approach, unfortunately, is myopic in its neglect of other stakeholders, such as the environment and the community. This course takes an alternative perspective, premised on climate change, deterioration of the marine ecosystem, and social inequalities as realities. It first examines how current consumption patterns are harming the environment and communities. It then delves into what responsible consumption entails and how consumers can be influenced to make product choices that are sustainable. Theories in psychology will be drawn on to provide that understanding of consumer behaviour. The course will also examine what companies can do to ensure that their marketing activities are aligned with sustainability goals. Case studies of companies with strong sustainability initiatives will be used to illuminate current best practices."

MKTG601,Marketing,"Marketing activity is the core of an operating business.   It provides the managerial focus for interfacing with customers and the source of intelligence about customers, competitors, and the general environment.  Managers must identify and measure consumers  needs and wants, assess the competitive environment, select the most appropriate customer targets and then develop marketing programs that satisfy consumers  needs better than the competition. Further, marketing focuses on the long-run relationship of a company to its customers as well as short- run sales and profits.
After three decades in which information technology (IT) was viewed by most senior executives as belonging solely to the  back office  of accounting and hum-drum transaction processing, IT has broken out. In many executive suites today, the talk now turns to the Internet, to electronic commerce, to knowledge management to network economy and to the issues involved in utilizing IT for  business transformation.  Understanding the new economy, which is at the interface of technology, economics and marketing is essential in successfully managing businesses in the future.
It is clear that, in an increasingly competitive global world, businesses must transform themselves to be more productive, to gather and store customer and competitive information and to capture the  tacit  knowledge that each employee holds in his/her head. Large software companies such as SAP, i2, and Oracle tout the potential to transform operations, supply chains, and customer relationships. A successful implementation of one of their software can provide new or better information to an organization s decision makers, and enable global manufacturing and distribution processes. On the other hand, botched implementations can stymie product and service deliveries and prove extremely costly in at least the short term.
Firms are transforming their entire supply chain. At one end of the supply chain, companies like GE and major automobile manufacturers are demanding that all their suppliers interact with through the Internet. On the other end of the value chain, both Internet start-up companies and more established brick-and-mortar firms are enabling customers throughout the world to buy from them through the Internet. Increasingly, firms are enabling their customers to look into their internal systems to assess when orders will be delivered.
Industries themselves are rapidly changing form and business methods. The music industry, for example,  because  of  MP3,  (even  after)  Napster,  peer-to-peer  networks  (like  Gnutella, LimeWire) and Apple s iPod and iTunes has undergone major transformation. More music is sold on-line than on CDs (Independent, may 12, 2012; http://www.independent.co.uk/arts- entertainment/music/news/more-music-downloads-sold-than-cds-7807443.html ). Amazon now sells more eBooks than printed books (BBC, August 6, 2012; http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19148146 ). New services have been created, some successful, such as on-line auctions (eBay, Ariba) and some not so successful such as grocery store delivery (Webvan). Partnerships and alliances are forming among former competitors, like competitors in technology services or transportation, in order to provide end-to-end services to large customers. New companies have emerged which have changed the way we communicate and share (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest) and pay (PayPal, Square). Google has led the way to monetize search (96% of its $39 billion revenue now comes from online advertising; http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/29/google-advertising/ ).
One of the main objectives of this course is to provide you with an understanding of the strategic marketing issues faced by firms in the network economy, with special emphasis on how this has affected traditional and technology firms. This course should equip you with conceptual frameworks and analytical tools required to understand the new economy and manage fast paced traditional and technology businesses."

The course objective is to provide students with an introduction to the fundamentals of marketing by introducing them to:

- The marketing concept
- A strategic marketing planning process
- Marketing analysis, including marketing research and consumer behaviour
- Market segmentation and brand positioning
- Product management, new product development and product life cycle.
- Pricing strategies.
- Brand building through integrated communications
- Leveraging distribution channels for competitive advantage
- New Marketing Trends

Additional objectives are:

- To introduce the student to the role of marketing in society.
- To expose the student to examples of how marketing has been applied.
- To improve presentation and writing skills and provide opportunities to articulate and defend positions.

The course has the dual purpose of introducing you to these concepts of marketing,  while also understanding how they fit together and operate in the real world. While a textbook provides more in- depth information about each of the components of marketing strategy, in the real world they operate together as an integrated plan and strategy. Case studies provide the experience of integrating the many aspects of marketing strategy analysis and planning. Thus, we use a textbook to give you a solid foundation and the cases to link your learning to the real world."
MKTG607,"Consumer Behaviour: Theory, Research Methods and Applications","Consumer Behaviour (CB) is the inter-disciplinary science of understanding the impact of marketing actions on consumers. This course has been specially designed to convey the essence of the most important CB theories (from individual level to macro level), the most essential research techniques, and applications of both theories and research techniques to diagnosing marketing problems and arriving at solutions. This course will help you improve your ability to anticipate consumer reactions, to predict their responses and most importantly, to measure the ultimate impact on consumers.  It is intended to help students who wish to work in consulting or in branding/marketing/advertising in B2C firms.

The course will provide:
1. An introduction to consumer behaviour theory on the effects of marketing on consumer awareness, perceptions, memory, attitudes and decision-making
2. A managerial guide to using the research techniques of systematic observation, qualitative research, surveys and experiments
3. A framework to use these theories and techniques in diagnosing and researching the most typical marketing decisions in B2C firms"
MKTG609,Strategic Marketing Management,"This course provides senior executives an understanding of the important function that Strategic Marketing plays in the long term performance of the firm. This module addresses the key challenges associated with aligning marketing activities with corporate strategy. It will provide frameworks, concepts, and tools necessary to ensure that marketing organizations are focused on the appropriate and measurable activities that drive business results and their marketing functions are staffed with and led by the right people.  In addition, the module explores the strategic opportunities and vulnerabilities associated with the management of customer relationships.  This is achieved by exploring approaches to building customer loyalty and developing effective systems to manage and maintain customer relationships."
MKTG616,Marketing: Integrating Strategy with Execution,"The Big Picture is an integrated Framework that helps marketers transform the way they analyze and solve the challenges and opportunities they face in their business.

The framework takes the form of a funnel, where each successive set of decisions brings increased focus to the strategy development and implementation planning process. These four steps help the student in answering four critical questions:

1. What is the firm s overall business objective?
2. What are the primary tenets of the firms  strategy?
3. What is the firm s executional plan?
4. How will the firm analyze and integrate results?"
MKTG617,Digital Marketing Strategy,"Total advertising spend worldwide will reach $518 billion (Financial Times, June 5, 2013, ZenithOptimedia). Online advertising spend will over $113 billion of which $37 billion will be spent in Asia Pacific (Group M, March 2013). 47% of the marketers in the US said that they will be shifting 20-30% of their traditional marketing spend to digital. Social network ad spend will reach $11 billion in 2014, 62% of it will be spent on Facebook (eMarketer, November 2012).

This new media presents many challenges to marketing professionals. Where once much of the ad spend devoted to traditional media was typically one way (i.e. from the firm to the consumer), the explosion of social media demands a two way conversation. The increasing use of user generated content and the platforms that facilitate their influence means that the firm does not have control on what messages are being circulated about the firm and its brands. Understanding the digital technologies, the social media tools and the mechanisms by which consumers get influenced is important in developing future marketing communication strategies. This course provides frameworks to understand the new digital marketing landscape and mechanisms on how firms can effectively develop their digital marketing strategies."
MKTG618,Marketing,"This module of the core will study the elements of modern marketing management as it applies to the profit seeking firm. The orientation of this course is toward the development and delivery of value through the process of exchange among the primary market parties, the firm, the customer and the collaborators. These actors are linked together in a market environment and the successful management of these relationships, whether through the creation of consistent incentive systems for all members or through the exertion of other types of influence, is crucial for the long-term competitive viability of the firm. The emphasis of this course is on developing and managing an efficient and effective marketing system capable of delivering extensive value in the marketplace to the firm, the customer and the collaborators."
MKTG619,Understanding Markets and Developing Business Models,"This module covers the basics of effective go-to-market strategies and sales management efforts in the context of an organization s ecosystem and collaborative ties with customers, suppliers, distributors, sales force etc. It is aimed at enabling students to perceive and create opportunities in markets that currently may not exist (or where current solutions may apply to other markets) and to appreciate effective positioning and strategic marketing issues/activities (incl. strategic pricing) with regard to innovative business models in an era of fast changing markets and shrinking product life cycles. Another key goal of the course unit is to ensure that students know how to create a greater market share for the respective innovation through successful market education, effective launch management tactics, brand leadership and value selling."
MKTG620,Managing Service Innovations,"This course introduces students to the basic conceptual frameworks and tools for crafting and delivering innovative service offerings to both b2b and b2c customers. To achieve these objectives, the students will be expected to carefully go through the assigned readings to understand the basics of management of service-based offerings. The course will be taught in the form of lectures and in-depth case study discussions."
MKTG622,Applied Marketing Research and Analytics,"Business managers utilize marketing data to assess the return on their investments and better understand their customers. Analyzing large marketing datasets also allows managers to recognize and justify their marketing mix decisions. This course is designed to meet the increasing needs of industry and recruiters in applying quantitative and analytical skills for advanced marketing decision-making. The content of this course is based on cutting-edge research in both academic and practitioner communities. The course provides students with an opportunity to analyze real-world marketing problems.

The best way to learn all the material in this course is through  hands-on  experience. As such, we will use recent developments in statistical science to examine solutions to important issues faced in marketing research. There will be various datasets and tools provided and used in the class to get practical experience about Marketing Analytics. Specifically, we will discuss market and segmentation techniques, regression and choice modeling, economic models of pricing, advertising and optimization techniques. The emphasis being on understanding, interpretation and proper use of marketing research techniques. One of the goals of this course is to train knowledgeable marketing managers who can evaluate the quality of marketing research and utilize the information to effectively make strategic decisions. The primary aim of this course is to learn new skills and tools that will provide students with important quantitative acumen for success in a marketing career."
MKTG624,Marketing Analytics,"This course is designed to meet the increasing needs of industry and recruiters in applying quantitative and analytical skills for understanding consumer decision-making.

The emphasis being on understanding, interpreting and proper use of these research techniques. The primary aim of this course is to learn new skills and tools that will provide students with important quantitative acumen for understanding consumer analytics."
MKTG625,Consumer Behaviour,"Virtually all decisions involved in developing an effective marketing mix for a product or service rely on in-depth knowledge of the consumers who comprise the target market. The success of many companies and non-profit organizations whether they be Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Apple, or TWG Tea lies in genuine insights into the minds, hearts, and behaviors of their target consumers. Thus, a clear understanding of the principles, concepts, and results of consumer behavior is critical to success in marketing. However, while all of us are
ourselves consumers, our intuitions about our own behavior as well as that of other consumers are unfortunately often inaccurate. This over-reliance on our own intuition has led managers astray, resulting in poor managerial
decision making for their organizations.

The purpose of this course is to help students gain insights into the principles and processes of consumer behavior. In doing so, students will be able to use their understanding of consumer behavior to evaluate and develop effective marketing strategies. To achieve these learning objectives, in this course we will directly
examine extant theory and research concerning the behavior of the consumer, with the goal of understanding how marketing managers can use these ideas to design their marketing programs. Knowledge of consumer behavior requires an understanding of important theoretical concepts from related fields such as psychology, sociology, economics, etc. Given the nature of the subject, while marketing applications will be discussed throughout the course, this course will be heavier on theory compared to other marketing courses."
MKTG626,Marketing,"Marketing activity is the core of an operating business.   It provides the managerial focus for interfacing with customers and the source of intelligence about customers, competitors, and the general environment.  Managers must identify and measure consumers  needs and wants, assess the competitive environment, select the most appropriate customer targets and then develop marketing programs that satisfy consumers  needs better than the competition. Further, marketing focuses on the long-run relationship of a company to its customers as well as short- run sales and profits.
After three decades in which information technology (IT) was viewed by most senior executives as belonging solely to the  back office  of accounting and hum-drum transaction processing, IT has broken out. In many executive suites today, the talk now turns to the Internet, to electronic commerce, to knowledge management to network economy and to the issues involved in utilizing IT for  business transformation.  Understanding the new economy, which is at the interface of technology, economics and marketing is essential in successfully managing businesses in the future.
It is clear that, in an increasingly competitive global world, businesses must transform themselves to be more productive, to gather and store customer and competitive information and to capture the  tacit  knowledge that each employee holds in his/her head. Large software companies such as SAP, i2, and Oracle tout the potential to transform operations, supply chains, and customer relationships. A successful implementation of one of their software can provide new or better information to an organization s decision makers, and enable global manufacturing and distribution processes. On the other hand, botched implementations can stymie product and service deliveries and prove extremely costly in at least the short term.
Firms are transforming their entire supply chain. At one end of the supply chain, companies like GE and major automobile manufacturers are demanding that all their suppliers interact with through the Internet. On the other end of the value chain, both Internet start-up companies and more established brick-and-mortar firms are enabling customers throughout the world to buy from them through the Internet. Increasingly, firms are enabling their customers to look into their internal systems to assess when orders will be delivered.
Industries themselves are rapidly changing form and business methods. The music industry, for example,  because  of  MP3,  (even  after)  Napster,  peer-to-peer  networks  (like  Gnutella, LimeWire) and Apple s iPod and iTunes has undergone major transformation. More music is sold on-line than on CDs (Independent, may 12, 2012; http://www.independent.co.uk/arts- entertainment/music/news/more-music-downloads-sold-than-cds-7807443.html ). Amazon now sells more eBooks than printed books (BBC, August 6, 2012; http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19148146 ). New services have been created, some successful, such as on-line auctions (eBay, Ariba) and some not so successful such as grocery store delivery (Webvan). Partnerships and alliances are forming among former competitors, like competitors in technology services or transportation, in order to provide end-to-end services to large customers. New companies have emerged which have changed the way we communicate and share (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest) and pay (PayPal, Square). Google has led the way to monetize search (96% of its $39 billion revenue now comes from online advertising; http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/29/google-advertising/ ).
One of the main objectives of this course is to provide you with an understanding of the strategic marketing issues faced by firms in the network economy, with special emphasis on how this has affected traditional and technology firms. This course should equip you with conceptual frameworks and analytical tools required to understand the new economy and manage fast paced traditional and technology businesses."
MKTG628,Digital Marketing,"The aim of this course is to prepare students for real world challenges in digital marketing.   This course will equip students with the essential knowledge, concepts and frameworks to analyse specific marketing issues, develop an integrated digital marketing strategy, monitor and measure its results.   It covers various digital marketing tools and online platforms used to formulate and implement digital marketing strategies.  Topics covered include digital transformation, new marketing normal, online presence, social platform, content marketing, social media marketing, paid social promotion, search engine optimization, paid search, lead nurturing and lead conversion, and online performance management.   Students will learn from an experiential learning approach which prepares them to make effective marketing decisions."
MKTG630,Advanced Marketing Strategy,"This course will take the CEO s perspective on marketing. Specifically, to build the marketing capabilities in you to address the marketing challenges topmost in the minds of CEOs today in the face of changing market place realities. 

The course will be based on the premise that marketing as a discipline has failed CEOs and companies. If marketing is to be effective in meeting the CEO and Board level challenges, then marketing has to become:

  more strategic, more cross-functional, and more bottom-line oriented
  effective in the face of new competitors like retailers, low cost rivals, and emerging giants
  help the transition to new channels and new media

Our focus will be on the business unit and its network of suppliers, channels, customer relationships, and alliances. Taking the viewpoint of the CEO and the general manager, the course will focus on three over-riding themes:

- Successful marketing strategies deliver superior customer value;
- Successful implementation of these strategies requires orchestrating the entire value network and marketing mix in an effective and consistent manner; and
- Marketing innovation can be used as a driver for changing the existing rules of the game in an industry."
MKTG632,Pricing,"The objective of this course is to introduce the application of pricing strategies for products to maximise profits for a company.  It aims to provide students with a roadmap and tools used in the real world that would enable organisations to use pricing to drive profitability and sustainable growth. Students will learn new perspectives for determining product pricing to maximize a firm s profits through creating and capturing customers.  This course provides insights into the strategies that pricing managers can employ to determine the appropriate price to capture the value created in products. It addresses the major pricing decisions confronting managers in today s competitive business environment by providing a comprehensive approach to managing pricing decisions in forward looking organisations.

This course is an extension of undergraduate course in Marketing, with specific focus on Pricing.  The topics are exchange value model, price/profit relationship, price segmentation, subscription pricing, psychological influences on pricing, pricing structures and dynamic pricing. Real life examples, articles and cases will be used to supplement the textbook."
MKTG633,Marketing Management,"The course will offer an introduction to marketing as a mindset, as a capability, and as techniques to reach the consumer. It will be assumed that the student has no formal training in the marketing discipline. While, it is not intended to go into depth on any of the subjects and areas of marketing that will be explored, the student should get a thorough introduction to what is marketing, how marketers think, and what are the various components of effective marketing, The electives are the place where students go deep into understanding marketing areas such as pricing, promotion, digital marketing and social media, big data, salesforce, omni-channel distribution, and branding. However, the students should expect to see all these topics covered at an introductory level and how they fit within an overarching marketing strategy."
MKTG634,Marketing Management,"The course will offer an introduction to marketing as a mindset, as a capability, and as techniques to reach the consumer. It will be assumed that the student has no formal training in the marketing discipline.

However, the students should expect to see all these topics covered at an introductory level and how they fit within an overarching marketing strategy."
MKTG636,Value Selling As a Driver of Business Growth,"Value selling is a corollary to earlier learning in this programme in subjects such as Marketing and Service Innovations. Value selling is a critical conceptual and marketing skill that is necessary in the formulation and presentation of your value proposition to clients, customers, collaborators and all other relevant stakeholders for your proposed or current innovations in products, services and systems. The essence of value selling is that customers buy the value of your product or service because they anticipate enjoying a beneficial outcome that they would not have in the absence of such a product or service. People do not buy products; they buy the results the product will give them. Value selling needs to be crafted to meet different situations or  contexts  that each organization is faced. It enables the organization and innovating teams to propose differentiated and winning solutions that are immediately recognized by the buying organization as being directly beneficial to their economic and other non-financial outcomes."
MKTG637,Marketing Research,"Understanding consumers is at the heart of a successful marketing process. Methods of generating consumer insights such as in-depth interviews and focus groups, ethnography, survey research, systematic observational research and experiments are key to diagnosing both the current status of a market, as well as the issues underlying a specific marketing challenge. The course will cover a variety of these methods of generating consumer insights and statistical methods used to analyze survey data.

Students will learn how to use insights generated to address marketing issues such as uncovering consumer needs, segmentation, product design, pricing structure, and evaluation of promotions.  The course will be taught using a combination of lectures, case discussions, in-class workshops, guest lectures and a group project. Students who wish to work in consulting or in branding/marketing/advertising in B2C organizations may find this course particularly useful."
MKTG638,Consumer Analytics,"Consumer Analytics involves designing, collecting, analyzing and presenting data-driven decisions using various approaches like statistical models, data mining techniques, simulations and tools. Organizations and business managers are increasingly utilizing data to assess the return on their investments, better understand their customers and improve their decision-making. Availability of large amounts of data, both structured and unstructured, has further increased the need to understand and extract all the relevant information from these data.

In this course, we will start from the basic idea about what is consumer and business analytics. We will delve into different types of analytics like descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics, different types of data, structured and unstructured, and different types of analysis and tools. As such, we will use developments in statistical science to examine solutions to important issues faced in consumer analytics. There will be various cases and readings provided and used in the class to demonstrate the importance of data-driven decision making. Specifically, we will discuss regression, measuring online impact, conducting field experiments, and new product and innovation related analytics. The main emphasis of this course is on understanding, interpreting and proper use of various research techniques and providing students with important quantitative acumen for appreciating consumer analytics."
MKTG639,Advanced Marketing Strategy,"This course will take the CEO s perspective on marketing. Specifically, to build the marketing capabilities in you to address the marketing challenges topmost in the minds of CEOs today in the face of changing market place realities. 

The course will be based on the premise that marketing as a discipline has failed CEOs and companies. If marketing is to be effective in meeting the CEO and Board level challenges, then marketing has to become:
  more strategic, more cross-functional, and more bottom-line oriented
  effective in the face of new competitors like retailers, low cost rivals, and emerging giants
  help the transition to new channels and new media"
MKTG640,Behavioural Science in Marketing,"The science of human behavior is a relatively new and interdisciplinary field of knowledge. Given its wide applicability and relevance, behavioural science has gained immense popularity in the last few years in its study and effective application in business contexts. In particular, the success of many companies and non-profit organizations from Apple, BMW, Coca Cola, Disney, to Zara lies in uncovering insights into the minds,hearts, and behaviours of their target consumers. These behavioural insights are based on what science tells us about systematic patterns in the behaviour of people in taking actions, making decisions, and forming intentions.

In this course, we will take a deeper look at the role behavioural science plays in people s path to action, whether it be search, evaluation, purchase behaviour, or more. We will examine how brands and companies leverage the theories and principles of behavioural science to shape, shift, or even completely disrupt people s preferences in marketing contexts with the aim to better achieve marketing objectives and positively impact the bottom line. We will also discuss the tools to implement and measure the impact of behavioral science. To achieve these learning objectives, in this course we will directly examine extant theory, research, and scientific findings concerning the behaviour of individuals, with the goal of understanding how marketing managers can use these ideas to design their products, advertising, and marketing programs."
MKTG641,Marketing for a Sustainable World,"Companies are increasingly called upon to respond to the sustainability issues that the world is confronted with, including climate change, deterioration and depletion of our natural environment, and social and wealth inequalities. This call for responsiveness comes from not just consumers, but also employees, the government and society at large.

A major driver of these issues is how much the world consumes and the type of products that are manufactured and consumed. Marketing has a significant role to play in tackling sustainability problems and it behooves marketers to equip themselves with the knowledge and skills that will enable them to be mindful and responsible marketers. Increasingly this will be a charge for marketers in all firms, large and small   B2C and B2B, local and international   to be sensitive to the environmental impact of all a marketer does.

The first half of the course examines the social and environmental impact of current consumption patterns and looks at how consumers can be influenced to make product choices that are sustainable. Theories in psychology will be drawn upon in looking at ways to change consumer behaviour and in examining the relationship between consumption and wellbeing.

The second half of the course looks at how traditional marketing tools can be modified and how new tools can be effectively applied to market sustainable products more effectively. For example, it delves into how a product can be designed, promoted, priced and distributed to mitigate its environmental impact over its entire life cycle (from supply chain to disposal). Case studies of companies with strong sustainability initiatives will be used to illuminate current best practices."
MKTG642,Digital Marketing,"The aim of this course is to prepare students for real world challenges in digital marketing.   This course will equip students with the essential knowledge, concepts and frameworks to analyse specific marketing issues, develop an integrated digital marketing strategy, monitor and measure its results.   It covers various digital marketing tools and online platforms used to formulate and implement digital marketing strategies.  Topics covered include digital transformation, new marketing normal, online presence, social platform, content marketing, social media marketing, paid social promotion, search engine optimization, paid search, lead nurturing and lead conversion, and online performance management.   Students will learn from an experiential learning approach which prepares them to make effective marketing decisions."
MKTG643,Entrepreneurial Marketing Strategy and Branding,"This course introduces students to the fundamentals of marketing for entrepreneurs to prepare them to develop an integrated marketing strategy in the digital age.   To prepare the students with the skill set to design, implement, and monitor their marketing plans, they will use an experiential learning approach to understand and practise the basics of entrepreneurial marketing."
MKTG702,Theory Construction,"The purpose of this doctoral seminar is to help students understand the nature of a theory, the theory construction process, and to develop skills in building interesting and impactful new theory. The focus is on the nuts and bolts of building new theory. The seminar will discuss theory as comprised of three core components. It will bring into sharp focus general structures of arguments that may be used to support different types of theoretical propositions in social sciences. It will identify characteristics of impactful theories, map the process of constructing theories, and provide guidelines for constructing impactful theories. Students will do hands-on exercises in theory construction in course of the seminar so as to better appreciate the nature of theory construction, the difficulties involved, and ways of addressing the difficulties successfully. The seminar is foundational to students interested in developing new theories."
MKTG703,Marketing Strategy,"This course is a doctoral seminar that focuses on marketing strategy formulation. Marketing strategy at a fundamental level has to do with how marketing concepts, tools, and processes can be used to help an organization develop a sustainable competitive advantage through the creation of superior customer value.
While marketing strategy is a comparatively young field of study, substantive and sustained contributions by many of the discipline s leading scholars over the last 30 years have helped create a rich and diverse literature base."
MKTG704,Consumer Behaviour,"Traditionally, consumer behaviour research can be roughly divided into two approaches. One approach takes an  Information Processing  ( IP ) perspective. In this perspective, the focus is on how/what consumers pay attention to, how they learn, how memory works in storing/retrieving information, and how this information affects consumers  attitudes, purchase intentions, and so on. There is thus a strong emphasis on the psychological underpinnings such as memory structures and processes and on their impact on persuasion and attitudes.

The second approach takes a  Judgment and Decision Making  perspective and is generally referred to as Behavioral Decision Theory ( BDT ). In this approach, the focus is to compare how one should behave (i.e., normative behavior) against how one actually behave(i.e., descriptive behaviour).  There is thus a strong emphasis on the  outcome  variable of consumer judgment and decision making process such as judgments, choices, and decisions and attempts to chronicle and explain how such behaviour deviate from normative behaviour.

Our course will introduce you to these two common approaches in consumer behaviour research. In the first part of the course we will be devoting our attention to understanding the  process  variables in consumer behavior through the IP perspective. In the second part of the course we will be looking at the  outcome  variables of consumer behaviour through the BDT perspective. Finally, in the last part of the course we will turn our attention to some of the contemporary topics in consumer behaviour research."
MKTG706,Experimental Design and Analysis for Behavioral Research,"This 0.5-credit course is aimed at Ph.D. students who intent to conduct experimental and quasi-experimental research in business (e.g., marketing, organizational behavior) and related disciplines (e.g., economics, psychology). The primary objective of the course is to provide such students with the concepts and tools needed for collecting and analyzing behavioral data.  A secondary objective is to provide these future academic reviewers the foundations for the methodological evaluation of other behavioral researchers' work.  The course thus covers the designs and analyses that are most often used by experimental researchers in the following fields: marketing, organizational behavior, and psychology.  Topics include: factorial designs, repeated (within-subject) and mixed designs, fractional (e.g., Latin squares) designs, analysis of covariance, etc.

We will examine these designs and analyses from the perspective of an applied behavioral researcher, not from that of a statistician.  That is, we will emphasize the actual use of proper data collection procedures and analysis techniques for rigorous (i.e., publishable) theory testing.  Although there will be sufficient coverage of statistical concepts (to ensure that the procedures and techniques are applied intelligently), we will not focus on statistical theory per se (as would related courses in a statistics department).

In addition to the objectives mentioned above, the course will offer students an opportunity to get started with the use of SAS, one of the most widely used statistical programming languages for manipulating and analyzing data.  While this will not be a course on SAS itself, students should become comfortable with this platform by the end of the course.  This comfort will eventually allow them to move on to more complex applications using SAS (or similar languages)."
MKTG707,Marketing Models II,"The purpose of the course is to introduce students to a wide range of applied topics in marketing models and specifically empirical models. It is divided into two parts, with the first part focusing on introduction and application of Bayesian methods and the second part emphasizing time series and panel data models.

It has become a common practice in marketing to use Hierarchical Bayesian (HB) models to capture and understand various marketing issues. The first part of the course will emphasize applying various Bayesian techniques using R statistical software.

The second part of the course incorporates various topics in time-series analysis (e.g. VAR modelling, state space and Kalman filtering techniques, dynamic panel data analysis). This latter part of the course will give students hands-on experience in applying these methods in Eviews and Stata.

This course will provide students necessary tools on which they can build their research. The course is expected to be highly interactive and would involve active student participation in the form of top-tier journal paper discussions and homework assignments. Students will be able to select the appropriate technique out of a wide array of modelling techniques currently prevalent in the marketing literature, and will be able to apply this technique for use in own research."
MKTG708,Marketing Strategy,"At a fundamental level marketing deals with how marketing concepts, tools, and processes can be used to help an organization develop a sustainable competitive advantage through the creation of superior customer value. The focus of this course is to give you a general overview of the different streams of research within marketing. We will typically cover a combination of classic papers and recent papers. These papers will cover topics that are of particular interest to managers. Although the reading list includes representative papers, it is by no means exhaustive. Therefore, the topical areas should serve as a starting point for those who are interested in delving deeper into a particular area."

Therefore, the topical areas should serve as a starting point for those who are interested in delving deeper into a particular area."
MKTG710,Marketing in the Global World,"Digital transformation is happening all around us and no area of life seems unaffected. In a customary sense, it refers to the use of computer and internet technology for a more efficient and effective economic value creation process. In a wider sense, digital transformation refers to the changes that new technology has on individuals and society at large: on how they operate, interact, and configure and how welfare is created within this system. It is by now clear, that the digital transformation has an obvious, lasting, and even revolutionary impact, not only on the economic systems and commercial players, but   increasingly on the lives of individuals and on society at large: In this course, we discuss on how new startups are disrupting the established industries and how established firms have to transformation their business to survive.

While the industry changes, how relevant is strategy and marketing? The argument is that the fundamentals of marketing will continue to drive successful businesses, one must not lose sight of the basic principles."
MKTG711,Behavioural Decision Research for Marketing Practice,"The purpose of this seminar is to provide Ph.D.-level coverage of various topics in behavioural decision research for marketing practice. The underlying philosophy of this seminar is that the gains of interdisciplinary and multi-method research far outweigh the pain and inconveniences associated with leaving one s  comfort zone.  Thus, for example, we will discuss how substantive marketing issues (e.g., reward programs, choice-set effects in retail, crowdfunding, product assortments) could benefit from an interdisciplinary marriage of methods (e.g., experiments and process measures, secondary data analysis, econometric and theoretical modeling). We will also read and analyse various articles that apply consumer behaviour insights on marketing practice.

Besides examining prior work and highlighting the benefits of cross-disciplinary research, the goal of this seminar is to improve your ability to identify interesting research questions and develop effective methods for testing them. In each session there will be a few required articles that will be analysed in detail. In addition, for most sessions there will be several additional background readings. While these additional readings are not mandatory, they are highly recommended as a starting point should you develop interest in that specific substantive area.

Class sessions will involve different components. We will, of course, discuss the assigned articles. When you read each of the assigned paper, make your own notes and write down questions. Try to understand (1) what is the research question being addressed, (2) what is the methodology used (and why it was chosen), (3) what are the main findings, (4) what are some possible alternative explanations to the results, and (5) how the research can be improved or extended (i.e., directions for future research). In some sessions, students will identify research ideas that build on the issues raised in the articles. The class will also develop methodologies for testing identified research ideas. In addition, you will be asked to e-mail the instructors (prior to every class) a brief bullet-point commentary on each article (further details will be given during our first meeting).

Finally, each student will be expected to write a paper presenting an original research idea and including the following:
  Very brief and very relevant literature review;
  Detailed conceptualisation and hypotheses generation;
  Detailed operationalisation and method;

  A stylised model, capturing the essence of the studied phenomenon (note: you need to show that this model is empirically testable) and;
  Very brief discussion. You will be asked to discuss and present your research idea in class (see class schedule). The instructor s approval for the topic and general methodology of the research is required. The paper is due by in Week 15 and should not exceed 20 pages (tables, figures, and references included). Your final course grade will be based on class participation (40%), the brief article commentaries (10%), preliminary proposal #1 (5%), preliminary proposal #2 (5%), and the research paper (40%)."
MKTG712,Empirical Marketing Models,"Empirical Marketing Models provides students with an essential skillset to conduct empirical research in marketing. This course will directly help students in the execution of their research projects, in handling reviewer comments, and may help them to come up with novel research ideas. Students will gain hands-on experience in applying the methods discussed.

The course starts by introducing students to the various sources of quantitative data that may be encountered in marketing. More specifically, the course will cover questionnaire and experimental data, novel types of data such as data from eye tracking and text mining, and sources of secondary data such as consumer panels and scanner data. In addition, the differences between cross-sectional, temporal, and panel data will be discussed. Finally, the link will be made between the different sources and types of data and causality. Then, the focus will shift to data analysis. The data analysis part of Empirical Marketing Models will start with an introduction to SPSS and basic hypothesis testing. Next, regression models will be discussed. Students will gain hands-on experience in specifying and estimating linear additive and multiplicative marketing models, both in SPSS and in Stata, and will learn how to derive elasticities. Next, common problems, and their solutions, will be discussed, including multicollinearity, endogeneity, serial correlation, and heteroscedasticity. Given that marketing data often comes in the form of panel data, e.g., transaction data for many customers over time, students will be introduced to random and fixed effects panel data models. Binary logistic regression models will form the next topic to allow students to analyse such variables as purchase incidence or coupon redemption. For new products no sales data are available. Conjoint analysis will be discussed as a solution to this problem. Cluster and factor analysis, two forms of multivariate data analysis, will be the next topics. Cluster analysis, or unsupervised machine learning, is an important tool for creating customer segments, and factor analysis is important when working with a (too) large number of correlated variables. Empirical Marketing Models will end with a discussion of various new developments in marketing models."
MKTG713,"Measurement, Questionnaire Design and Data Analysis","This course will cover the fundamental elements of designing and evaluating questionnaires (commonly used in survey research, among other research methods). We will begin with an overview of measurement and measurement scales. We will then focus on the process of responding to questions, challenges, and options for asking a variety of questions about attitudinal and behavioral responses. In particular, we will review commonly used question formats, practical techniques for evaluating questions, and mode specific questionnaire characteristics. We will also review the fundamentals in analysing data from these various question formats. To exemplify key concepts discussed, we will use marketing as the illustrative context: we will present examples through marketing research surveys and discuss how questionnaire methodology is applied to study marketing problems."
MKTG714,Marketing Strategy I,"This course is a doctoral seminar that focuses on marketing strategy formulation. Marketing strategy at a fundamental level has to do with how marketing concepts, tools, and processes can be used to help an organisation develop a sustainable competitive advantage through the creation of superior customer value. While marketing strategy is a comparatively young field of study, substantive and sustained contributions by many of the discipline 's leading scholars over the last 30 years have helped create a rich and diverse literature base."

OBHR211,"Governing, Managing and Protecting Knowledge in Organisations","The creation and management of knowledge and intellectual capital, knowledge-based work, knowledge workers etc. have become key preconditions for sustained corporate, regional or societal competitiveness in an era of rapid globalisation. Besides exploring the on-going shift towards a knowledge society/economy, the theoretical and empirical origins, definitions and domains of knowledge management (KM), its use and practical implications in terms of human resource management etc., the course will try to provide answers to the following core question: Which forms of creating and utilizing knowledge can enable both individuals and organisations to transform learning and innovative capabilities into key competencies? The course focuses on both the theoretical and applied literature on knowledge-based society/economy, knowledge work(ers) and knowledge management. Several case studies will be analysed aimed at illustrating the challenges managers experienced who tried to find answers to the issue raised above as well as to outline the benefits and consequences of  good  KM."
OBHR212,Cross-Cultural Management & the Management of Diversity,"With an increasingly globalized economy, managing employees of different cultural background becomes an imperative in organizations. This module takes the approach of understanding how culture differs and impacts on our interactions at the workplace. The course is broadly structured to enable an understanding of (a) cultures, (b) within culture differences, (c) between culture differences with an emphasis on how these similarities and differences impact workplace interactions. Case studies, role plays and self assessments will be used to provide students with both an academic and practical foundation in this area."
OBHR217,Leadership Skills & Practices,"This course is designed to help students understand the critical role that leadership plays in the success of organizations. In addition, we will discuss what leadership is, how it is best assessed and the different techniques to foster leadership development. Special focus will be placed on how leadership theories and research can lead to practical and lasting benefits to organizations. Students will also be encouraged to reflect on their own leadership styles and to consider how they can improve their effectiveness as current and future leaders."
OBHR218,Negotiation Skills for Business,"Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between parties who are interdependent, are seeking to maximize their own outcomes, and may or may not be interested in developing or preserving a close relationship. This course is designed to be relevant to the broad spectrum of negotiation problems faced by managers and professionals. A basic premise of this course is that while any manager or professional needs analytical skills to discover optimal solutions to problems, negotiation skills are usually needed to get these solutions accepted and implemented. This course provides participants with conceptual and analytical tools for analyzing and planning their negotiations. It also provides participants with simulated negotiation experiences that allow them to develop their negotiating skills, and to understand how the conceptual and analytical tools can be used in practice."
OBHR221,Managerial Decision Making,"The course provides participants with conceptual and analytical tools for analyzing decision situations, dealing with uncertainty, choosing options, and implementing decisions. It also highlights common decision biases and traps and shows how they can be avoided. The quality of decision making determines whether a company rides the waves of success or falters. Good decision making is an art and a skill that helps managers to choose and implement the right actions to achieve organizational goals in the face of uncertainty. Good decision making considers not only economic perspectives, but a broad spectrum of objectives to ensure decisions make ethical and business sense. This course is designed to be relevant to a broad spectrum of decision making situations faced by managers and other professionals."
OBHR227,Managing Work-life Balance  Myth or Reality?,"We live in a fast paced and globalised world.  Singapore was ranked 90th out of 151 countries in the Happiness Index in 2012 dropping from its 49th position in 2009.  Employees in Singapore work the longest number of hours among top cities in the world and are stressed and overworked.  People in Singapore are calling for a better work-life balance, with more time for self and family.  Companies, on the other hand, are constantly faced with fierce competition and, recently, the labour  squeeze  (due to the recent tightening of foreign labour).  The challenge for HR managers and employers is to find an amicable balance to meet the needs of employees and yet help the company stay competitive.  Is this possible? How can companies attract, develop and retain the right talent?  What are the issues involved and how do people cope with multiple roles and demands? What are the services, schemes and networks that companies and employees can leverage on for support and direction?  What can employees do to manage life changes? How can employees better manage time, resources and stress effectively?  What are some of the tools and experiences they can draw on?"
OBHR101,Management of People at Work,"This course focuses on managing people in the workplace. Students learn theoretical and conceptual foundations for understanding people, groups, and organizations, and practical tools for accomplishing personal, group, and organizational objectives with a long term view to creating a sustainable and ethical environment for the individual to thrive and flourish.

OBHR202,Compensation,"This course examines the current practices, beliefs, and principles on how organisations decide on their total rewards strategy. Aside from providing a core base of knowledge, the course will also provide practical perspectives in performance management and compensation. The course looks into fixed compensation and also examines models of variable compensation and their linkages to performance management. The course provides an opportunity for the student to learn how compensation is structured and how the concept of  pay for performance  can work across different industries.

The course includes methods of job evaluation for determining pay grades/scales, incentive-based pay approaches (including short- and long-term incentives, sales compensation and executive compensation), and international compensation. It also touches on performance management tools and implementation of performance management challenges in organizations."
OBHR203,Talent Acquisition and Assessment,"This course focuses on the attraction, recruitment, selection, and assessment of talent into organizations. This course is designed to provide students with a broad overview of these fields by exposing them to a variety of relevant theories, concepts, findings, unresolved issues, and recent trends. An organizing theme, which cuts across the diverse topic areas covered in this course, is the commitment to empirical evidence that currently characterize the fields of human resource management and organizational behaviour. Students will learn how to use effective talent acquisition and talent assessment approaches to achieve sustained competitive advantage for organizations. They will also learn to critically evaluate recent talent acquisition and talent assessment trends."
OBHR204,Training & Development,"This course introduces students to the theories, application and skills development aspects of Training and Development. Students will learn how to assess, design, develop, implement and evaluate a training program. In this regard, basic concepts of training, including total needs assessment, trainees  learning motivations, learning and transfer theories as well as evaluation methods will be covered.

OBHR213,Decision Making,"Individual and group decision making, creative decision making techniques and abilities, decision biases and errors."
OBHR214,Managing with Power,"Understanding and mapping the political landscape of an organisation, strategies for selling issues within an organisation, principles and tactics of influencing others within an organisation."
OBHR215,Organisational Change & Design,"This course looks at how different organizational design choices facilitate or impede the achievement of organizational goals in the midst of ongoing market competition. It also highlights the need to initiate and manage ongoing and proactive organizational change programs to transform or sustain the organization.   
This module is valuable for students interested in pursuing a career in Human Resource Development or Organizational Development as it enables them to learn how to design an effective organization structure and culture as well as carry out planned organizational changes."
OBHR216,Theory & Practice of Consulting,"Role of internal and external consultants and experts in a knowledge economy; definition, nature and evolution of consulting as a profession, stages of the consulting process; consulting / project management skills; types of management consulting projects; auditing clients  business capabilities; frameworks and problem-solving approaches; marketing and negotiating with clients, ethics in consulting."
OBHR219,Contemporary Theories of Leadership,"This special topics elective course will pick up where most leadership courses end.  We will go beyond traditional leadership theories to examine recent research and theory on various leadership topics.  We will be reading from primary source outlets (e.g., journal articles, edited book chapters) on cutting edge topics in leadership and its development.  Beginning with an examination of leaders and their impact (e.g., impact on followers as well as on performance) we will focus on topics such as destructive leadership, change leadership, leadership development, team learning, and meaning-making.  The capstone experience in the course will involve designing and presenting a leadership development program for a financial services company based on a case study that we will read.

There are three basic learning objectives of the course: (a) To help develop critical thinking and reasoning skills about leadership research and theory; (b) to improve reading comprehension skills in  making sense  of scholarly research; and (c) to challenge your existing thinking about the meaning, practice, and development of leadership.  An overarching objective is to encourage participants   ownership  and control of their educational experience as a way to enhance deep learning about the topics covered in the readings and discussion."
OBHR220,Working and Leading in High-Performance Teams,"In modern organizations, most work is accomplished in teams. Importantly, teams are not only the work horses of organizations, but they are increasingly used to tackle the most important and strategic issues facing organizations.  Teams are charged with making important decisions, developing innovations, and solving complex problems. Thus, being able to develop and maintain high-performance teams is a crucial success factor for organizations. For individuals, their value to an organization depends to a large extend on how well they function as members and leaders of teams. Importantly team leadership is increasingly expected from all members of a team, rather than being tied to a specific official role; and team roles are becoming more and more fluid and situational. Moreover, organizations employ various types of teams, such as virtual teams, calling for increasing sophistication from their employees. The purpose of this course is to expose students to these issues and to make them familiar both with research and theory on teams as well as to increase their competency to work and lead in teams. Topics include team performance, team development, team innovation, team decision making, conflict in teams, and types of teams."
OBHR224,Human Capital Strategy,"This course introduces you to the importance of implementing business strategies through people strategies. The pedagogy of the course is designed to develop your practical perspective on Human Capital Strategy and its critical importance for the success of an organization. We will explore Human Capital practices and processes through three amalgamated approaches.

  Academic knowledge- We will understand the concepts of different strategic models to drive business growth. You will learn the various aspects of culture, structure, compensation, talent, and leadership that shape the human capital strategy of the organizations.

  Business Insights- We will analyze latest events, unicorns, business case studies and articles to appreciate the changing business landscape. You will get opportunities to interact with established business/HR leaders to share the industry insights during the module.

  Action Learning- We will engage in the Human Capital Challenge (HCC) strategic business simulation game to help you learn by doing. You will make decisions based on human capital concepts and various market conditions to improve your own company performance."
OBHR226,"Strategic HR Transformation, Analytics and HR Metrics","The professional practice of HR has evolved from personnel management to HRM & HRD, to Human Capital Management, and now to Talent Management. Today, with the increasing popularity of social media and Web 2.0 / 3.0, HR practice continues to evolve; a recent development is the newly coined role of Chief HR Officer (CHRO).

Using outsourcing and best practices, the HCM and Talent Management approach frees up the time and resources of senior HR professionals so that they can move from operational HR issues to focus on strategic HR issues and HR transformation.

Several well-known authors and institutions have also developed frameworks related to Workforce 2020, describing the skills needed in less than ten years  time. These new competencies have to be within sight of HR professionals as part of the HR transformation work."
OBHR228,The Psychology of Managerial Decision Making,"The quality of decision making determines whether a company rides the waves of success or falters. Good decision making is an art and a skill that helps managers to choose and implement the right actions to achieve organizational goals in the face of uncertainty. Good decision making considers not only economic perspectives, but a broad spectrum of objectives to ensure decisions make ethical and business sense. This course focuses on familiarizing you with the foundations of descriptive and prescriptive (and less so, normative) aspects of decision making in individual, group, and organizational settings. Topics include information processing, heuristics and biases, decision frames, managerial risk perceptions, affective influences on decision making, intuition and expertise, ethical decision making, and group decision making."
OBHR229,Talent Management,"The course enables you to discover the astonishing world of Talent Management. With the basic knowledge obtained from Human Capital Management and Managing People at Work, this module will provide you with an advanced understanding of a big part of Human Resource Management. Students will delve deeper into the practical aspects of talent management and understand how IT and social media can play a significant role in enabling how HR processes and systems can be managed.  The course will provide a strategic overview of fundamental people management challenges.  Targeted application of IT and social media in recruitment and selection, managing new entrants, compensation considerations and improving overall retention will be studied in detail.  More attention will be focused on the impact of employer branding, succession planning and employee separation; i.e. dismissal, retirement and redundancy."
OBHR230,Seminar with Chief Human Resource Officers and Human Resource Practitioners,"This course is designed to give students opportunities to interact with about 10 CHROs/regional heads of HR/ HR Directors during the semester. The invited speakers will come from a myriad of backgrounds so as to provide diversity in views and unique environmental circumstances. They will each share their views on the challenges that their respective organizations/companies face in human capital management issues. Following each sharing session, class will discuss the learnings from the speakers and reflect against what they have learnt from their earlier HR modules.  Alternative solutions will be mooted that may solve the challenges faced by the different speakers.  The students will be expected to individually reflect and pen down their personal thoughts on the matters discussed. Experiential based learning activities will also be introduced to allow students to exercise their ability to size challenges and choose a course of action based on the deemed environmental circumstances."
OBHR231,The Mosaic of Leadership,"Leadership is a highly sought-after and highly valued capability in business today. This course is designed to help students recognize and consider such questions as:  What makes a good leader?   How do people become better leaders?  and  What should I do to become the leader I want to be?  We will explore the ever-changing mosaic of leadership to consider the theories, practices, and examples of leadership all around us. Students will have a unique opportunity to complete a leadership profile and reflect on their own leadership styles and behaviors. This course is designed to help prepare students as future business leaders who are well equipped to address the challenges of leadership."
OBHR232,Employment Law for Business Professionals,"This course is designed to impart to you an understanding of the employment law regime in Singapore. In this regard, you will acquire an awareness of the employment landscape and key employment-related laws in Singapore. You will learn to identify and address key issues that impact employment and affect employment relationships. You will develop a working understanding of the key  buckets  of employment law, from hiring, managing, terminating, to post-termination matters. This involves studying requirements and issues relating to the following non-exhaustive list of topics:

Hiring employees, including looking at fair hiring guidelines on non-discriminatory and  locals-first  policies in Singapore; and hiring of foreign manpower; 

Managing employees, including looking at employers  and employees  rights and obligations under law; employment contracts, including what they comprise and how they govern an employment relationship; and workplace safety and health matters, an area under significant scrutiny given COVID-19;

Terminating employees, including whether and how employees can be dismissed from the workplace; how retrenchment exercises work; and the respective pitfalls; 

Industrial relations, including how they affect the hiring, managing and termination phases of the employment relationship; and

Post-termination concerns, including confidentiality and non-competition/solicitation obligations.  

Through the course, you will be exposed to the different sources of employment law, including legislation, case law, tripartite guidelines, advisories issued by the Ministry of Manpower, amongst others. You will understand how the tripartite relationship between the Government, employers and unions work and affect these. In this respect, this is a very grounded course, which will require you to develop a clear understanding of the employment legal regime and then think practically on how to navigate employment issues. 

This course will be especially pertinent to students interested in pursuing a career as a HR professional, as well as to other business professionals including those interested in management or business in general. In either role, a firm grasp of employment law means that you will be able to proactively identify and flag potential issues, hence value-adding to management."
OBHR233,Overseas Project Experience (Employer Branding for Human Resource - Asia),"The way in which generational cohorts behave at the work place and perceive engagement may differ in many aspects. Millennials are best positioned to provide insights into how millennial employees are recruited and how they should be engaged in the work place.  In the context of a human resources related issue proposed by a client organization (e.g., Millennial talent management and engagement, Employer branding and recruitment), participants from Singapore and Indonesia are to collaborate with each other to present proposals to the client organisation. These issues are reflective of human resources challenges faced by organisations today, as seen in the following articles: 

https://hbr.org/2015/05/ceos-need-to-pay-attention-to-employer-branding
https://iveybusinessjournal.com/publication/the-millennials-a-new-generation-of-employees-a-new-set-of-engagement-policies/
https://hbr.org/2018/03/the-new-rules-of-talent-management

This is a SMU-X overseas course where SMU will partner with an overseas university/organisation on studying real projects faced by the overseas partner. Participants from both countries will be equipped with human resources theories and cultural context from the respective universities faculty members. Participants will also need to be physically present in both countries for meetings, discussions, briefings and presentations during the required module phases."
OBHR234,Power and Politics in Organisations,"Power, status, and influence are topics that make many people a little uncomfortable. However, power is a fundamental reality in much (maybe all) of organizational and social life. Power and influence are key mechanisms by which things get done.

This course is designed so that you will learn concepts useful for understanding power and influence, and ways of analyzing power dynamics in organizations. Even more importantly, the course encourages you to think about and develop your own personal path to power (which can include, of course, a path away from power), as well as to develop your skills in exercising power and influence to make you more comfortable with  managing with power.  The course will also introduce difficult ethical questions associated with the use of power and influence, and challenge you to define for yourself what constitutes the ethical exercise of power and influence in your life.

The materials and ideas that form the basis for much of the course have been selected because they challenge many aspects of conventional wisdom or the taken-for-granted assumptions that many people hold about the sources of success and influence. The ideas and concepts are, however, well grounded in empirical literature in the behavioral and social sciences. If some of the readings or discussions disagree with your ideas or cause you to feel uncomfortable, that discomfort is part and parcel of the learning process."
OBHR235,Human Resources Consulting,"The aim of this course is to help students learn about the world of HR consulting with an opportunity to develop skills that can be applied to HR consulting projects. To do this, students will learn the whole consulting process. These include consulting methodologies, building and managing client relationships, assessing consulting outcomes and more. The context of the consulting process will be done with reference to the different HR domains and functions. This will help students to have a comprehensive understanding of the people (HR) challenges that organisations face and for which HR consulting may help resolve. As all consulting projects involve change of some form, the key principles of change management will also be explored.  

This course assumes some level of HR knowledge and practices. Hence, due to the nature of the content that will be covered, it is highly recommended that students take the Human Capital Management course prior to taking this HR Consulting course."
OBHR298,Managing Generation Y in a Multigenerational Workforce,"This course focuses on managing multiple generations in the workplace. Students will develop an understanding of their own generation, Generation Y, as well as learn about the dynamics of interacting with Generation X and Baby Boomers. Through case studies and self-reflection exercises, students will appreciate the generalized traits, behaviours, values, motivators, as well as the world events that have shaped each generation. Students will be challenged to think about how to manage and overcome generational differences in order to facilitate a productive and efficient workplace."
OBHR299,Special Topics in Organisational Behaviour,"These courses will be offered, usually on an ad hoc basis, to cover topics not already included in our ongoing courses. For example, a course may be offered to address a particular contemporary business issue; or a visiting faculty member may offer a course in his/her specific area of expertise."
OBHR300,Human Resources Analytics,"The future of the HR profession lies in analytics. No professional entering the field can expect to succeed in his or her career without a solid understanding and hands-on practice of analytical tools to help in making people decisions.

To implement their business strategies effectively, leaders must deal with people issues in a way that allows them to gain competitive advantage through people. The organizations that will win the  war for talent  will be those which are better at identifying and keeping key talent, motivating high performance, developing and promoting staff and predicting future people needs accurately. HR professionals need analytics to address these challenges. For exam-ple, linking pay-for-performance has been a dogma of management, but recent research shows that most incentive plans do not produce the desired behavior, and that pay, in fact, has little correlation to business results.

To succeed in the business world, it is imperative that HR provide data-driven answers and insights on how to implement and execute strategy through the people in the organization. The course provides students with practi-cal, hands-on approaches to connect HR policies and practices to business performance. You will review key statis-tics and finance concepts, such as ROI and people productivity; become familiar with available tools such as Workday and Tableau to complement Excel and others; discuss data collection, clean-up and warehousing; prac-tice building descriptive and predictive models; and get hands-on experience in applications for workforce planning, recruitment, compensation, training, career planning and turnover. At the end of the semester, you will be able to put HR analytics skills and tools to good use."
OBHR301,Group Dynamics in Organisations,"Organizations are increasingly relying on teams to generate solutions required for sustained business success. However, it can be extremely challenging for leaders to manage teams effectively in today s diverse, digital and dynamic times. This course examines the design, management, and leadership of teams in organizational settings and focuses on more than just formal team leadership as all team members can play leadership roles in teams. This is an advanced course which builds on and extends foundational knowledge learnt in OBHR101 with a specific focus on group dynamics. It provides detailed knowledge of how group and intergroup dynamics affect both individual functioning but also organisation-level outcomes. The emphasis is understanding the interpersonal processes and structural characteristics that influence the effectiveness of teams, the dynamics of intra-team relationships, and sharing of knowledge and information in teams. This course is designed to provide you with perspectives and skills that will help you to develop and manage high impact teams. Topics include understanding the foundations of high performing teams, decision-making in teams, managing team conflict; team creativity and innovation; leading diverse and virtual teams, among others."
OBHR302,The Science and Practice of Mindfulness at Work,"Our world is characterized by the related phenomena of VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity) and overload (of attention, information, stimulation, and work). This affects our attention, emotions, cognitions, well-being, functioning, and performance. It challenges our ability to flourish, to both feel well and do well. In this course, we explore the science and practice of mindfulness as a way of flourishing at work and in life. Mindfulness-based practices are rooted in Eastern contemplative traditions but have been adapted to a secular, modern context. A large amount of research has accumulated showing that such mindfulness-based practices confer numerous benefits both for well-being and functioning, including at the workplace.
 Mindfulness at work  has two meanings in this course: First, we will focus on mindfulness in the context of work and organizations. Second, we will incorporate mindfulness practices such as mindfulness meditations into the course itself. Thus, in this course, we will examine both the science as well as the practice of mindfulness. For the science aspect, we will read and discuss scientific research studies on mindfulness. For the practice aspect, we will engage in regular practice based on established and carefully designed secular mindfulness trainings. The practice aspect is integral to this course and students will be required to commit about 20-45 minutes daily to these practices. Evidence suggests that the practices can make you feel and function better and are a good investment of your time."
OBHR602,Negotiating in Business,"Professional success is largely dependent on one s success in managing differences and fostering collaboration among people and organizations. However, in today s highly dynamic and complex managerial environment, which is marked by increasing interdependence and often by conflicts of interest, it can be extremely challenging to bring together the relevant  players     internal and external stakeholders who have different interests, perceptions, attitudes, behaviours, or values    to forge efficient, profitable, and lasting agreements. Professionals who understand the science and practice of negotiation are much better equipped to navigate these differences and create agreements that advance their own interests, and also the interests of the other parties involved."
OBHR605,Leading in a Global Environment,"In an ever-changing global business environment, organisational leaders need to effectively manage and motivate employees, lead change initiatives, and foster creativity to sustain business growth and success. In this course, you will learn and understand what effective leadership means, how it can be practiced, and how to further individual, team, and organisational effectiveness.

This course is designed specifically for senior executives, and other professionals operating in or aspiring to senior leadership positions. Such individuals act directly as leaders, and also operate as members of leadership teams, typically in complex culturally diverse organisational environments. To be successful in such roles and environments, you will benefit from a deeper understanding of leadership broadly defined, including insights for motivating employees, influencing peers and bosses, leading global teams, managing diversity, leading organisational change, and fostering greater organisational creativity."
OBHR609,Leadership in Organizations,"Organisational leaders need to sustain business growth, manage and motivate associates, and harness passion in the face of adversity. Participants will learn and understand what effective leadership means and how it can be practiced, how to build high-performance teams, and how to further their individual, team, and organisational effectiveness.

This course is designed specifically for CFOs, aspiring CFOS, and other professionals operating in or aspiring to financial leadership positions. Such individuals act directly as leaders, and also operate as members of leadership teams, typically in complex organizational environments. To be successful in such roles and environments, professionals will benefit from a deeper understanding of leadership broadly defined, including strategies for leading organisational change, leading teams, motivating employees, negotiation and conflict, and leading via networks, power, and politics. This course aims to provide such an understanding."
OBHR611,Research in Organisational Behaviour,"The goal of the seminar will be to familiarize students with the central concepts in organizational behavior research.  Topics will cover the established constructs which are mainstays of our research field (e.g., organizational justice, job satisfaction, job performance, personality).  Each week we will focus on a topic or research area important to the field of organisational behaviour. Student seminar leaders will guide discussion, with the professor providing additional background, depth, or insight to the readings as necessary.  Students will be evaluated on participation, seminar leading, and a final paper."
OBHR612,Research in Strategic Human Resource Management,"This doctoral-level seminar provides students with an overview of research in the domain of Human Resource Management (HRM) and Strategic Human Resource Management (SHRM). In particular, the seminar s discussions and assignments deal with theoretical, conceptual, and empirical issues in staffing, employer branding, performance management, compensation, training and development, turnover, as well as broader strategic Human Resource Management.
The focus is on the individual (micro) as well as the organisational (macro) level. In one session (employer branding), there is also a strong marketing focus.
Articles are specifically chosen to illustrate a variety of methods that go beyond survey methods and experimental designs. So, the seminar also features articles using text analysis, machine learning, archival analysis, experience sampling, observation, social network analysis, and qualitative research. A similar variety is observed in the statistical analyses presented throughout the articles. Accordingly, the seminar goes beyond the content focus on (S)HRM and discusses key research skills that are pivotal to anyone pursuing a PhD in OBHR and Strategy."
OBHR613,Negotiating in Business,"Professional success is largely dependent on one s success in managing differences and fostering collaboration among people and organizations. However, in today s highly dynamic and complex managerial environment, it can be extremely challenging to bring relevant  players     internal and external stakeholders who have different interests, perceptions, attitudes, behaviours, or values    together to forge efficient, profitable, and lasting agreements. Professionals who understand the science and practice of negotiation will be much better equipped to navigate these differences and create agreements that advance their own interests, and also the interests of the other parties involved."
OBHR614,Leading People and Organizations,"Professional success in today s complex organisations depends not only on technical, functional, and professional skills, but also on the ability to navigate the people side of organisations: to successfully work with and through  others  to achieve  individual,  group, and organisational  objectives.  To be successful,  professionals will benefit from a deeper understanding of leadership broadly  defined, including approaches   for  motivating employees, leading teams, making and  implementing organisational  decisions,  assessing  organisational  culture, leading organisational  change, and managing across cultures. This course aims to provide such understanding."
OBHR615,Organizational Behavior and Leadership,"As a young executive, you derive a large part of your prior successes at work from your own talent and ability to perform specific tasks or projects assigned to you by your supervisors. However, as your career progresses, you inevitably have to make the transition to take on more managerial and leadership responsibilities in your organization. Typically, this transition calls for greater ability to manage and lead others toward larger organizational goals. Your success is no longer solely dependent on yourself but on others  ability and willingness to work with you.

This course is designed to introduce fundamental aspects of what it means to manage and lead groups of people.  We will examine the key challenges that a young manager may face in contemporary organizations, focusing on topics such as influencing and motivating others, building effective teams, leading change, building creative organizations, and developing one s own career path. We will take a global perspective but with an Asian emphasis to explore these challenges, drawing on real-world case studies from around Asia and beyond.

This course aims to provide you with a set of critical concepts and frameworks that would help you make the transition from an individual contributor to an organizational leader.  This set of concepts and frameworks would serve as a useful toolkit for you as you navigate the complex world of being an effective manager and leader."
OBHR616,Negotiations and Partnerships,"Professional success is largely dependent on one s success in managing differences and fostering collaboration between people, groups, and organizations. However, in today s highly dynamic and complex managerial environment,  it can be extremely  challenging  to bring together  the relevant  players     internal and external stakeholders who have different interests, perceptions,  attitudes, behaviours, or values   to forge efficient,  profitable,  and lasting agreements. Professionals who understand the science and practice of negotiation are much better equipped to navigate these differences and create agreements that advance their own interests, and also the interests of the other parties involved."
OBHR617,Negotiating in Business,"We negotiate every day. We negotiate with potential employers, co-workers, roommates, landlords, parents, bosses, merchants, service providers, spouses, and even our children. What price we want to pay, how much we want to be paid, who will do the dishes...all of these are negotiations. Yet, although people negotiate all the time, most know very little about the strategy and psychology of effective negotiations. Why do we sometimes get our way whereas other times we walk away feeling frustrated by our inability to obtain the agreement we desire?

Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more interdependent parties. This course is designed to be relevant to a broad spectrum of negotiation problems that are faced by managers and professionals. It is also designed to complement the technical and diagnostic skills that are learned in other courses at the SMU. A basic premise of this course is that while managers need analytical skills to develop optimal solutions to problems, they also require a broad array of negotiation skills for these solutions to be accepted and implemented. Successful completion of this course will enable you to recognize, understand, and analyse essential concepts in negotiations."
OBHR621,Leadership and People Management,"- Leadership
- Leaders as Change Managers/Agents
- Leaders as Conflict Managers"
OBHR622,Organizational Aspects of Making innovation Work,"This course addresses the organizational requirements of effective innovation management. With innovation as a critical part of strategy, businesses are exploring new ways to foster innovation to help lead to breakthrough ideas, products, and services. While many organizations understand the need for innovation, few have been able to help drive innovative thinking, creative processes, and effective innovation governance. After a short recap of the various forms (e.g. process innovations) and types (e.g. incremental vs. radical) of innovations as well as the stages of the innovation process, students will be introduced two key levers of making innovation work in order to create a balanced yet ambitious, strategic  innovation portfolio  (comprising core, adjacent and transformational innovations): technology and business model innovation. Participants will learn what it takes to develop a well governed innovation management framework to avoid the classical traps of  good  innovation management in terms of strategy (e.g. no coherent innovation strategy), structure (too many silos), process (e.g. no rapid prototyping approach) and innovation culture (e.g. too little emphasis on people-oriented building blocks of culture such as values, behavior and climate)."
OBHR624,Managing People and Organisations,"One s professional success in today s complex organisations depends not only on technical, functional, and professional skills, but also on the ability to navigate the people side of organisations: to successfully work with and through others to achieve individual, group, and organisational objectives. Professionals will therefore benefit from a deeper understanding, and an ability to apply, a range of concepts and frameworks for managing people and organisations. This course aims to provide such understanding and ability."
OBHR628,Evidence-based Approach to Talent Management,"Talent is critical to the creation of organisational human capital.  We focus on talent activities including recruitment, selection, assessment, retention, and dismissal of employees.  In addition, we go beyond these core activities to evaluate the trade-offs of short-term and long-term strategies that improve organisational performance, morale, and diversity.  Areas such as employer branding, diversity, and work-life balance also are explored.

We will take an evidence-based and experiential approach to explore these talent management activities, reflecting and drawing on the recent evidence and on real-world case studies from around Asia and beyond. Readings (reflecting a selection of classics as well as cutting edge ideas) are assigned before each of the first four course sessions. The course will also consist of a business game in which one experiences first hand the short-term and long-term implications of strategic talent decisions on key deliverables such as productivity, morale, diversity, and turnover.

Taken together, the concepts, frameworks, and approaches resulting from the readings and case studies together with the applied and experiential experience of the business game will provide you with key and invaluable leverage for resourcing and building a talent rich organisation."
OBHR629,"Leading, Managing and Developing People","One s professional success in today s complex organisations depends not only on technical, functional, and professional skills, but also on the ability to navigate the people side of organisations: to successfully work with and through others to achieve individual, group, and organisational objectives. Professionals will therefore benefit from a deeper understanding of, and an ability to apply, a range of concepts and frameworks for managing people and organisations. This course aims to provide such understanding and ability."
OBHR630,Strategic Rewards Management,"This module examines total rewards in an organisational context. The course equips learners with the knowledge and understanding of the ways in which reward professionals plan, implement and evaluate employee reward policies to support strategic organisational goals. Students will acquire both theoretical and practical understanding of the diverse approaches to reward management. At the end of the course students will be able to critically reflect on the strengths and limitations of these approaches in promoting individual and organisational performance. The module examines the foundations for pay and benefits management in modern organisations in the private, public and non-profit sectors. Specifically,  we will look at how these can be integrated into appropriate designs that consider relative value and worth, individual and team contributions, and the market data. We will have a special look at benefits sales compensation and executive pay arrangements."
OBHR631,Innovation Management,"This course introduces students to the theory and practice of innovation management aimed at creating and capturing value in organizations on the basis of novel ideas, products, services and processes. While many business leaders appreciate the need for innovation, few have been able to create a robust culture of innovation and succeeded in implementing effective innovation governance structures. Besides defining the various types and forms of innovation (e.g. incremental vs. transformational innovation) vis- -vis the stages of the innovation value chain, students will be familiarised with some of the key levers and process tools of making innovation work (internally and externally with partners) such as portfolio management or open innovation aimed at creating a strategic set of core, adjacent and transformational innovations for business success."
OBHR633,Human Capital,"Human capital   people   is the most important asset in most organization. But it is also perhaps the most complicated to manage. Every employee has different strengths and weaknesses that need to be matched to their role. Realizing those employees  potential also requires long term investment in their skills and development. And getting the most out of them means keeping them motivated and engaged, and managing the conflicts that inevitably occur in the workplace.
In this module, we will cover different techniques for effectively managing human capital, drawing on current research and examples as well as the experiences of participants. Through lecture, case discussion, simulations and group exercises, we will examine the problems that can occur in managing human capital and the best practices for managing them."

OBHR636,Learning and Talent Development,"The objective of this course is to develop a critical understanding of learning and talent development (LTD) policies and strategies that enable the development of intellectual, social, professional and personal skills to perform effectively in an organisation.  The course is designed to give students a sound introduction to learning and development (L&D) practices that are anchored on key L&D theories and models.  To be specific, this course will take the students through the L&D process that includes strategic L&D, learning needs analysis, L&D design, L&D implementation and L&D evaluation."
OBHR637,Managing Change in Organizations," Everything changes and nothing stands still.   Heraclitus

Managing change is a core leadership skill in today s constantly changing and VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) work environment. Despite this, few leaders manage change well. The brutal fact is   70% of all change initiatives fail   which is why mastering this skill is not only important to future-proof your organization, but also your career.

This course has been developed to arm you with practical skills and hands on tools for planning, leading and managing change in organizations. This course will:
- Deepen your understanding of the challenges and the problems that are associated with initiating and implementing change in an organization
- Enhance your skills for leading, managing and implementing organizational change
- Expose you to cases of successful and non-successful cases of change while showing you why some change initiatives fail and what pitfalls you should avoid

This is an interactive course. In addition to lectures, discussions, and Q&A, you will learn through debates, role-plays, case analyses, workshops, and talks by seasoned practitioner(s) of change management. A simulation is also included in this course to hone and crystalize your learning."
OBHR638,Negotiations in an HR Context,"Professional success is largely dependent on one s success in managing differences and fostering collaboration among people and organizations. However, in today s highly dynamic and complex managerial environment, which is marked by increasing interdependence and often by conflicts of interest, it can be extremely challenging to bring together the relevant  players     internal and external stakeholders who have different interests, perceptions, attitudes, behaviours, or values    to forge efficient, profitable, and lasting agreements. HR Professionals who understand the science and practice of negotiation are much better equipped to navigate these differences and create agreements that advance their own interests, and also the interests of the other parties involved."
OBHR639,The Challenges and Opportunities of HC Analytics,"This course addresses applications of data, metrics, and analytics to human resources. It focuses on strategic aspects e.g., using data to align HR activities with business goals as well as operational elements involving the collection, analysis, and reporting of people data. The course builds individual capabilities in quantitative reasoning and prepares students to make evidence-based recommendations for enhancing HR systems and practices.
One of the key objectives for this course is to make you better able to leverage HR data for making decisions about how and where to invest in talent. By the end of the course, you should feel more comfortable working with HR data, be able to define and identify key HR metrics, be able to identify actionable insights from HR data and analysis, and feel more confident in discussing and presenting analytical information. We will use numerous company examples to illustrate concepts and practices throughout the course."
OBHR640,Managing Organizational Change,"If there is one prediction that I can make with confidence regarding your careers after you graduate from Singapore Management University s program, it is that change will be a constant presence in your organizational lives.  Anticipating and managing change, therefore, will be a necessary skill for you as you move forward in your career.  
One of the key objectives for this course is to make you better at diagnosing organizational issues, and in particular to make you more aware of the interrelatedness of organizational decisions.  The success of change efforts that you make in your career after leaving here will depend, in large part, on how well you can anticipate the myriad effects of change efforts, and deal with those that you could not anticipate.  Thus, we will bring multiple lenses to bear on each case, and examine situations from a variety of angles."
OBHR641,Organizational Aspects of Making innovation Work,"Both innovation leadership and  good  innovation management are indispensable in order to determine the strategic goals of innovation efforts, to structure and organise related work efforts so that things get done and to ensure a compelling innovation vision. In this new  live case innovation course , students will be familiarized with relevant innovation management concepts as well as selected tools in order to create and capture value during the innovation process from invention to successful commercialization. Based on a real-world innovation challenge provided by a Singapore-based company in the services sector (Bridge Alliance), students will be enabled to appreciate the strategic importance of developing outstanding innovation capabilities so as to avoid the classical traps of making innovation work in organizations in terms of strategy, process, structure, culture, skills and so forth. Working with a real client (Live Case: Bridge Alliance), students will not only obtain a deep and meaningful understanding of the innovation topic but also hone their analytical and communicative skills in developing value-added innovation management strategies and decision-making. The course structure will feature alternating session units aimed at internalizing relevant concepts and frameworks as well as mastering their applications in a real organizational context based on the theory and practice of  good  innovation management and governance."
OBHR642,Negotiating in Business: Innovation and Entrepreneurship,"Professional success in innovation and entrepreneurship is largely dependent on one s success in managing differences and fostering collaboration among people and organizations. However, in today s highly dynamic and complex business and managerial environment, which is marked by increasing interdependence and differing motivations, it can be extremely challenging to bring together the relevant  players     internal and external stakeholders who have different interests, perceptions, attitudes, behaviours, or values    to forge efficient, profitable, and lasting agreements. Professionals who understand the science and practice of negotiation are much better equipped to navigate these differences and create agreements that advance their own interests, and also the interests of the other parties involved."
OBHR643,Leading for Innovation in Entrepreneurial Environments,"How one leads is contingent on the environment one operates in. In a fast paced and constantly changing entrepreneurial environment, what does a leader need to do to enable innovative offerings for its stakeholders? Taking a cue from Microsoft s Satya Nadella, a mind-set change is essential. In particular, a leader needs to cultivate a growth mind-set among employees   moving employees from their  know it all  mind-sets to  learn it all  mind-sets.  However, this learning journey necessitates the need for continual experimentation which can possibly lead to failures at times. How can a leader therefore find the sweet spot that allows employees to experiment, fail and yet be successful?"
OBHR644,Managing Teams,"Organizations are increasingly relying on teams to generate solutions required for sustained business success. However, it can be extremely challenging for leaders to manage teams effectively in today s diverse, digital and dynamic times. This course examines the design, management, and leadership of teams in organizational settings. The focus is on the interpersonal processes and structural characteristics that influence the effectiveness of teams, the dynamics of intra-team relationships, and sharing of knowledge and information in teams. This course is designed to provide you with perspectives and skills that will help you to develop and manage high impact teams. Topics include understanding the foundations of high performing teams, decision-making in teams, managing team conflict; team creativity and innovation; leading diverse and virtual teams, among others."
OBHR645,Leading YourSelf,"The prerequisite of organisational leadership and managerial effectiveness is the capacity to lead and manage oneself.  To this end, the module will take students on an enriching inner journey through which they will learn to unveil and develop their qualities thanks to the empowering experience of deep meditation. The module will integrate notions of holistic wellbeing with positive psychology and eastern philosophy to provide a balanced learning experience connecting knowledge development with practical wisdom."
OBHR646,HC Analytics and Research for Management Insights,"Human capital (HC) decisions are increasingly based on rigorous evidence and analysis. This course is divided into two sections that cover (1) research methods used to generate rigorous evidence and (2) analytical methods used to generate insights for HC decisions.

Research methods represent the  how  of the scientific study of theoretical and applied questions. Appropriate research methods allow us to rigorously investigate and develop evidence to address important problems. This section of the course is an introductory master-level seminar on empirical research methods in the context of business research. It will focus on different types of research designs and methods, such as lab experiments, field experiments, and survey research. It is meant to help students make informed choices about designing and conducting their own research studies effectively and ethically.

HC analytics focuses on the use of people data for HC decisions and it involves mapping HC initiatives to business outcomes.  The key benefits of employing HC analytics include quantifying returns on HC investments and optimizing employee investments to achieve tangible business outcomes. However, the challenge faced by HC practitioners lies in knowing what to analyze and how to analyze.  Reports have revealed that only a small percentage of HC practitioners are proficient in undertaking advanced univariate analyses and that an even fewer number can perform advanced multivariate analyses.  This proficiency gap suggests a need for HC practitioners to be more competent in this field. The focus of this section of the course is to narrow this gap, allowing HC professionals to play a more strategic role within their organizations through equipping them with the ability to undertake some useful HC analytics on available organizational employee data. The course will use the SPSS software package, chosen for its ease of use and commercial accessibility."
OBHR647,Management of Human Capital in Organisations,"Professional success in today s complex organisations depends not only on technical, functional, and professional skills, but also on the ability to successfully work with and through others to achieve organisational objectives.  This course focuses on managing people in the workplace.  Students learn theoretical and conceptual foundations for understanding people, groups, and organizations, and practical tools for accomplishing individual, team, and organizational objectives.  Topics include leadership, managing change, managing diversity, building effective teams, work motivation, emotions and stress, influencing others and decision-making."
OBHR700,Organisational Behaviour,"Organisational Behaviour (OB) research focuses on the experiences and behavior of individuals, dyads, and groups within organisations. The field s disciplinary foundations are primarily in psychology (particularly industrial-organizational psychology, social psychology, differential psychology, and cultural psychology), and also sociology, anthropology, political science, and others. Many of the most popular  airport bookstore  topics   such as leadership, motivation, performance, teams, networks, talent management, rewards and recognition, trust   are OB topics. The field of OB, as we will study it in this class, focuses on the scientific study of these and many other topics."
OBHR701,Decision Making,"This course provides an introduction, at the PhD level, to research in the area of Judgment and Decision Making (JDM). The quality of judgments and decisions exerts a strong influence on the success of individuals, groups, and organizations. Given this, much of the research on decision making has compared normative models of decision making (how rational agents would make decisions) with how people and organizations actually make decisions (descriptive models). Further, given that judgments and decisions are made in all domains of human activity, research on JDM is very interdisciplinary. This will be reflected in the course readings, allowing you to get a broader perspective on the field. In this course, we will critically discuss some of the important research findings and methods of this literature. You will also develop your own research proposal."
OBHR702,Leadership,"This doctoral seminar in Leadership/Organisational Behaviour seeks to provide students with a basic understanding of the main areas of Organisational Behaviour   the study of individuals and groups within organisations. The focus is on understanding the frameworks used to understand the research traditions in the field with an eye on applying the research findings into practice. This seminar seeks to equip students with the ability to conduct empirical research that is rigorous and readily translatable into ideas practitioners are able to use.

The six sessions are developed around the main areas of research in the organisational field; leadership, motivation, trust and justice, individual differences, and values/attitudes/moods but is in no way reflective of the entire field."
OBHR703,Trust Within Organisations,"Trust is frequently considered to be a crucial element of organizational functioning, leadership effectiveness, and interpersonal work relationships. And many organizational, leadership, and interpersonal dysfunctions can be attributed to weaknesses or failures in trust. Fortunately, over the last 25 years organizational scholars have built a large base of scientific knowledge on trust within organizations, comprising scores if not hundreds of double-blind peer-reviewed studies. Unfortunately, little of this research has been put into practice. This seminar aims to introduce students to the scientific research on trust, and then consider how that research can be extended and/or how the research and methods can be leveraged to address trust issues within organizations."
OBHR704,Leadership Research,"As uncertainty becomes the norm after Brexit and the rise of populism in politics globally, businesses need to adapt their strategy. As leaders, we also have challenges that influence the future growth and sustainability of business. In this course, we discuss some of the key principles behind leading under conditions of uncertainty. There are components associated with individual and team behaviours, but also about leadership at a strategic level and managing organizational change."
OBHR705,Research on Innovation Leadership and Governance,"Innovation represents a key source of differentiation and competitive advantage in today s VUCA environment. Both  good  innovation leadership and  good  innovation governance are indispensable in order to determine the strategic goals of innovation efforts, to drive innovative thinking, creative processes and ideation, to structure and organise related work efforts so that things get done and to ensure a compelling innovation vision. While many organisations understand the need for innovation leadership and governance, the effectiveness of leadership for innovation - broadly speaking   varies greatly. Central to effective innovation leadership and governance are effective leaders with the right abilities who can match their competencies with the respective innovation situation they find themselves in. In this course, we will explore this challenge with the help of various theoretical frameworks and empirical studies to appreciate what it takes to avoid the classical traps of making innovation work in organisations in terms of strategy, process, structure, culture, skills and so forth. The course structure features alternating session units aimed at (i) internalising relevant concepts and frameworks as well as (ii) knowing how innovation practitioners lead and govern innovation efforts in real organisational contexts based on class discussions led by students and selected guests.

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

  Appreciate the important role of leadership and governance in fostering innovation and creativity
  Know what it takes to be an effective innovation leader  
  Understand key innovation leadership principles and terms
  Analyse and interpret existing empirical findings of innovation leadership studies
  Apply key concepts, themes, and findings to various research paradigms and organisations"
OBHR706,Evolutionary Perspective on Organisational Behaviour,"This course is designed to develop the ability to understand, analyse, and predict human behaviour in organisations through the lense of evolutionary (ultimate) causation. All behaviour evolved through the process of natural selection. Traditional social science focuses on modelling human behaviour at the proximal level (e.g., a husband is more likely to hit his wife if he is jealous). While sometimes useful, such models can be considered micro-redescriptions rather than explanations of human behaviour. True explanations reference ultimate causation (why does jealousy exist?) and as such can at the same time lead to a profound understanding of who we are (revealing fundamental truths about human beings) as well as when and why we do what we do (thus improving on the traditional social science models predicting behaviour). The course will focus on key behaviours relevant to organisational life and the topics will also be partly customised around students  interests."
OBHR710,Research in Workplace Affect and Attitudes,"The seminar covers basic psychological research in affect and emotions, in addition to research on work attitudes. The course then covers specific applications of affect in the workplace, and current research addressing predictors and outcomes of both affect and attitudes in the workplace."

OBHR714,Research in Motivation,"Motivation is a fundamental topic for any and all work-related behavior.  The goal of the seminar will be to familiarize students with the central topics in motivation research.  Topics will cover both process (e.g., goal setting, control theory) and content theories (e.g., self-determination theory, needs theories) of motivation.  Each week we will focus on a topic or research area important to the field of motivation; student seminar leaders will guide discussion, with the professor providing additional background, depth, or insight to the readings as necessary.  Students will be evaluated on participation, seminar leading, and a final paper."
OBHR715,Research in Negotiation,"In this seminar, we aim to understand the methods and findings in core and contemporary areas of business negotiation research. Topics will include some or all of the following: Research foundations in game theory and collective bargaining, research methods in studying negotiation, distributive and integrative negotiation, power and negotiation, third-party negotiation (mediation, arbitration, and managers as third parties), multiparty negotiation and coalitions, individual differences in negotiation, the role of trust in negotiation, affect in negotiation, and negotiation process and dynamics. Students will read foundational and noteworthy articles in the above areas, participate actively in seminar discussions, and write a research paper."
OBHR716,Research in Organisational and National/Societal Culture,"This seminar covers methods and findings in classic and contemporary research on culture with a particular focus on research applications in the areas of organizational behavior and human resources management. Each week, a different set of papers on a specific area of research will be discussed in seminar style. Special emphasis will be given to research on East Asian cultures. The goal of the seminar is to put students in a position to conduct their own original research to advance our understanding of the role of culture in organizational behavior and human resources management."
OBHR717,Research in Organisational Trust,"In this seminar, we aim to understand the methods and findings in core and contemporary areas of trust research. Topics will include some or all of the following: Research foundations in game theory, close relationships, and sociology; research methods in studying trust; conceptualization and measurement of trust; functions of trust; determinants of trust; dynamic nature of trust; trust in the context of leadership; trust repair; affect and trust; group-level trust, trust across cultures, and trust networks. Students will read foundational and noteworthy articles in the above areas, participate actively in seminar discussions, and write a research paper."
OBHR718,Research in Performance Management,"This seminar covers methods and findings in performance management research. Each week will cover different areas including effective performance management systems, goal-setting, coaching and feedback, performance appraisals, and employee development. The goal of the seminar is to develop the students' skills in identifying and testing interesting research ideas in the area of performance management."
OBHR719,Research in Power and Politics,"In this seminar, we aim to understand the methods and findings in core and contemporary research on power and politics. Topics will include some or all of the following: Basic theories of power and politics; theories and applications to organizational behaviour and human resources; research methods in studying power and politics; positive and negative effects of the use of power and politics; ethical issues; individual differences. Students will read foundational and noteworthy articles in the above areas, participate actively in seminar discussions, and write a research paper."
OBHR720,Assessing and Developing Theory in OBHR,"A well-developed theoretical framework is a key component of any study which contributes to organizational behavior research. The goal of this seminar will be to familiarize students with the major theories used in organizational behavior research, and to sharpen their critical skills for developing and evaluating organizational behavior theories. Topics may include attribution theory, social categorization theory, sensemaking proceses, power and status theories, and social comparison theory. Each week we will focus on a topic or research area important to the field of motivation; student seminar leaders will guide discussion, with the professor providing additional background, depth, or insight to the readings as necessary. Students will be evaluated on participation, seminar leading, and a final paper."
OBHR721,Experimental Business Research,"Experimentation presents a valuable approach to collecting empirical data in order to better understand business phenomena. This course will cover the logic of experimentation and its advantages and limitations, experimental design, and experimentation in business research. We will examine both laboratory and field experimentation. The course will also go over a number of actual examples of experimental business research that we will examine together for their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, as part of this course, you will develop and present a proposal for an experimental investigation of a research question in a business context."
OBHR722,Scale Development,"Appropriate measurement of psychological and behavioral constructs is imperative to scientific inquiry.  Given the importance of good measurement and the fact that most research in organisational behaviour and human resources utilises scales to measure phenomena of interest, the objectives of this course are to develop one s ability to critique existing scales and to develop new ones.  As such, we will focus on the fundamental principles and processes of scale development (e.g., item generation, item selection, scale refinement) that result in reliable and valid scales."
OBHR723,Longitudinal Research in Organisational Behaviour,"This course addresses the conceptual underpinnings, the design, and the statistical analysis of longitudinal research in organizational behaviour. The course will cover research that examines long-term change as well as research that examines within-person variability in short time frames such as experience sampling studies. The objective of the course is to enable students to conduct longitudinal research in their domain of interest. In the first sessions of the class, we will examine the add-on value of explicitly incorporating time into theoretical models and empirical studies. We will then review different longitudinal research designs and discuss how they can be implemented effectively. In the last sessions, students will gain hand-on experience on basic strategies to analyze longitudinal data."
OBHR724,Research in Creativity,"It is widely acknowledged that creative thinking is a key to individual and business success in the 21st century. In recent years, creativity research has gained considerable traction in the field of management and organisational behavior. This course focuses on research in creativity in an organisational setting. Through this course, you will be exposed to classic as well as contemporary research in creativity. You will gain a good understanding and appreciation of how scholars define and measure creativity. As the field is constantly evolving, you will be challenged to assess current research critically and propose new perspectives and approaches to think about creativity research.

This course employs a seminar format. We meet every week to discuss the set of assigned readings (see reading list below). My role is that of a general facilitator and moderator. Each week, one or two students (depending on class size) will be responsible for leading the class discussion and summarizing the key takeaways and themes; it will be everyone s responsibility to contribute actively to class discussions.

At the end of the course, you should
a. know the latest development in cross-cultural organisational behavior research
b. understand and appreciate the various approaches toward Chinese
     management research
c. be able to identify the challenges of and opportunities in developing Chinese
    management theories and doing research in China.
d. develop new ideas that further pushes the frontier of cross-cultural research or
     Chinese management
       research"
OBHR725,Culture and Chinese Management Research,"Observers of the global economy often tout the 21st century as either a global century or an Asian century. This observation comes from the recognition that economic activities have become increasingly global in nature as people and goods cross national boundaries. Additionally, a new driver of global economy, China, has arrived on the scene. By many estimates, China is poised to overtake the United States as the largest economy in the world within the next decade, if not earlier. Given these developments, understanding organisational behavior in a global business environment and specifically in the Chinese context has become more important than ever. This course serves to introduce you to some cutting edge ideas on cross-cultural organisational behavior and emerging ideas on Chinese management research.

This course employs a seminar format. We meet every week to discuss the set of assigned readings (see reading list below). My role is that of a general facilitator and moderator. Each week, one or two students (depending on class size) will be responsible for leading the class discussion and summarizing the key takeaways and themes; it will be everyone s responsibility to contribute actively to class discussions."
OBHR726,Qualitative Research Methods,"The purpose of this course is to help you better understand qualitative research methods so as to enable you to be a better researcher and reviewer of work that employs these types of methodologies. Given the breadth and variety of methods that fall under the rubric of  qualitative methods,  some classes will discuss general issues or skills that are applicable to several different methodological approaches (e.g., gaining access), while others will focus more specifically on a particular approach (e.g., ethnography).  You will notice that there is not a separate week on ethics.  Ethical treatment of those we study is crucial to all methodologies (quantitative and qualitative)   but ethical issues can be particularly acute in some forms of qualitative research.  As a result, we will integrate discussions of ethics throughout the course, and not relegate it to a weekly topic of discussion.

Qualitative methods courses in business schools are relatively rare. Ask most established qualitative researchers and they will talk about being trained using the apprenticeship model only. Taken together, this is both an exciting challenge and a daunting one   as there are few templates for such a course.  Consequently, your input will be essential in helping me refine and redesign the course as we go along. Thus, unlike other methods courses where you are  served  information, this course will be more like a  pot luck  with you bringing things to the class every week!

There will be at least two main avenues for learning in this class:

1. Each week we will read and discuss what other researchers have written about a specific topic.  During the term, you will also do research on a specific methodology not covered in class. These will be the most  traditional  parts of class.

2. There will be an  articles in the spotlight  each week. Selection of these articles was based on a variety of factors.  Many are award winning.  Most generally, I tried to pick articles that illustrate a specific methodological point (s) for a given week.  In addition to reading these articles for their theoretical content, we will discuss them in detail from a methodological standpoint. We will be addressing issues such as the following:  What makes this good (or bad) qualitative research?    What decisions did they have to make when deciding which information to include and which to leave out?    Was I convinced by the author s (or authors ) arguments? 

To close, this course will be a lot of work -- but I also hope that it will also be enriching and fun!  By the time we are finished, you should have begun developing a unique skill set that should serve you well during graduate school and beyond."
OBHR727,Psychology of Workplace Technology,"The world of work is undergoing a rapid transformation on account of technology. It is critical to understand the impact of this transformation on employees and organisations. In order to do so, the course will draw on organisational scholarship related to the psychology of workplace technology."
OBHR728,Psychological Interventions,"This course focuses on a psychological (as opposed to structural or policy-based) approach to implementing positive interventions in organisations and societies. Psychological interventions directly influence individual psychology to promote wellbeing or performance. Examples of psychological interventions include such techniques as reflecting on a challenge in a positive light, purposefully thinking about one s capabilities as something that can be grown and developed, or reflecting on one s important values to reaffirm the self.

Psychological interventions can often be implemented cheaply and on a large scale, and they have already been successfully used in fostering positive change in several key domains of social life, including exercise and weight loss (Samuel Hodge et al., 2009), marital quality (Finkel, Slotter, Luchies, Walton, & Gross, 2013), and environmentally friendly behaviour (Goldstein, Cialdini, & Griskevicius, 2008). Yet, psychological interventions are underutilised in organisations, and future generations of organisational researchers have an opportunity to leverage this approach to promote positive change, from inducing a higher sense of meaning at work, to reducing stress experienced by marginalised groups, and aiding the adjustment of such employees.

We will review foundational social psychological work on psychological interventions and learn about key theoretical principles. These will then be applied to four broad areas of key importance to organisations, and corresponding to student interest: implicit theories, coping, social cohesion, and emotion regulation. In the final session, we consider the role of technology (big data and algorithms) in applying as well as exploiting psychological intervention strategies."
OBHR729,Research in Emotions,"Over the last two decades research on emotions in organizational behaviour has rapidly increased. In this course, we will review theoretical and empirical research on emotions. This research will span different levels of analysis (e.g., within-person, between-persons, teams, etc.), and will consider specific topics such as emotional labor, emotional contagion, and emotional intelligence."
OBHR730,Pro-Seminar in Organisational Behaviour & Human Resources,"The purpose of this course is to introduce area members  main research topics and interests to the new PhD students. Each week, one or two faculty members will discuss their research work so as to expose new PhD students to interesting problems in the field. The key objective of this course is to jump start the matching process between students and PhD supervisors."
OBHR731,Core Theories in Social Psychology,"This years  course focuses on social psychology of group processes. Groupwork (teamwork), and, more broadly, collaboration among organizational members are fundamental to organizational success. Yet, team-level, and more broadly, meso-level organizational dynamics represent important and understudied topics in organizational research. Part of the challenge has been on complexity of meso-level phenomena, which introduces both theoretical and methodological challenges. The course aims to provide an overview of social psychological research on groups on the one hand, and organizational behavior research on teams on the other, and in that way identify theoretically rigorous and productive ways of studying groups in organizations. The course further emphasizes discussion of existing projects on teams (by more senior students) and development of new ideas to refine team-level theorizing and study design skills."
OBHR732,Applied Theories in Social Psychology,"The course introduces a cross-disciplinary perspective on aversive states such as negative mood and depressed self-esteem, as well as traits such as neuroticism and other psychological resources. We will review evolutionary and developmental perspectives, as well as theories of stress, coping, and self-regulation in psychology and organisational studies, and identify opportunities for future research. By the end of the course the students should be familiar with a number of relatively fundamental and important research traditions in psychology that constitute an important part of OB researcher s theoretical toolkit."
OBHR733,Cross-Cultural Management Research,"Observers of the global economy often tout the 21st century as a global century. This observation comes from the recognition that economic activities have become increasingly global in nature as people and goods cross national boundaries. Given these developments, understanding organizational behavior in a global business environment has become more important than ever. This course serves to introduce you to some classic as well as cutting edge ideas on cross-cultural organizational behavior and management research.

This course employs a seminar format. We meet every week to discuss the set of assigned readings (see reading list below). My role is that of a general facilitator and moderator. Each session, students will be assigned to lead the class discussion for specific papers; it will be everyone s responsibility to contribute actively to class discussions."
OBHR734,Leadership,"This doctoral seminar in Leadership/Organisational Behaviour seeks to provide students with a basic understanding of the main areas of Organisational Behaviour   the study of individuals and groups within organisations. The focus is on understanding the frameworks used to understand the research traditions in the field with an eye on applying the research findings into practice. This seminar seeks to equip students with the ability to conduct empirical research that is rigorous and readily translatable into ideas practitioners are able to use.

The six sessions are developed around the main areas of research in the organisational field; leadership, motivation, trust and justice, individual differences, and values/attitudes/moods but is in no way reflective of the entire field."
OBHR735,Flourishing at Work,"This course provides an introduction, at the PhD level, to research in the area of flourishing at work. Most people tend to spend a large part of their waking hours working / at work. As a consequence, work is more than a source of income but also is an important source and determinant of our wellbeing. Traditional theories have emphasized how work can contribute to human suffering, for example, through as alienation, stress, harassment, discrimination, and burnout. But work can also be a source of human flourishing. This aspect has been gaining more attention through developments such as scholarship on positive organizational scholarship, positive psychology, and mindfulness at work. In this course, we will critically discuss some of the important theoretical approaches, methods, and empirical findings on flourishing at work. In parallel, to gain first-hand experience, we will also try out for ourselves some of the practices and interventions that have been proposed, studied, and validated in this research."
OBHR736,OBHR Criteria,"Criteria are what researchers and practitioners attempt to understand, predict, and influence. Criteria span various levels including individuals, groups, and organisations. Depending on the aim of one s theorising, research or application, different criteria may be more or less relevant. Understanding how criteria are conceptualised and operationalised is critical. In this course, we will review and discuss various commonly investigated individual, group, and organisational criteria."
OPIM101,Decision Analysis,"The objective of this course is to introduce students to decision analysis, which is the application of the scientific method to managerial and personal decision-making. Selected decision analysis tools will be introduced to help making decisions in certain and uncertain environments, such as linear and integer programming and decision trees. The usefulness of these tools will be illustrated through examples drawn from all functional areas of business. These example applications include capacity and inventory management, portfolio management, supply chain management and project scheduling."
OPIM201,Operations Management,"Companies produce and deliver goods or services to meet customer demand through various operations. In this course, students discover how the operations of any organization can be designed, analyzed and improved to lift its performance, whether the organization is a bank, a hospital, a resort, a manufacturing plant, or a fashion retailer.  The course reveals how operations management skills can be used to reduce costs, lower inventories, cut waiting times, improve quality, enhance service levels, increase revenues and company profits, and potentially improve the environmental and social sustainability performances.  Specifically, students will gain practical knowledge of process analysis and design, demand forecasting, capacity planning, workflow planning and control, inventory management, quality management, and lean operations. With a focus on the basic concepts that govern operations management, the course also provides the necessary foundation to pursue further development in business management."
OPIM311,Service Processes,"This course explores the dimensions of successful service firms through the use of case studies and lectures.  It prepares students for enlightened management and suggests creative entrepreneurial opportunities.  Outstanding service organizations are managed differently than their ""merely good"" competitors.  Actions are based on totally different assumptions about the way success is achieved.  The results show not only in terms of conventional measures of performance but also in the enthusiasm of the employees and quality of customer satisfaction.  Beginning with the service encounter, service managers must blend marketing, technology, people, and information to achieve a distinctive competitive advantage. As the service sector is the fastest-growing sector of the economy, this course is also intended to help students discover entrepreneurial opportunities."
OPIM313,Project Management,"This course aims to provide students with a sound understanding and knowledge of basic concepts and analytical skills critical to effective project management in any industry. The students will acquire a range of  soft  skills (behavioral) and  hard  (analytical) tools and techniques, and learn how to link theory to real-world projects. Topics covered include project selection, initiation, planning, implementation, control and evaluation. With the project life cycle in mind, topics such as the role of the project manager and organization, scheduling and resources allocation will also be covered."
OPIM314,Logistics and Transportation Management,"Transportation is an integral part of the global supply chain system. Goods cannot move on their own from supply points to demand locations, conferring transportation a central role in the global distribution of freight. Transportation creates value-add in a supply chain by performing the ""moving"" function in the physical distribution of products and it facilitates international trade and hence globalisation. In broader terms, transport connectivity is often referred to as the lifeline of a nation and is often a precondition for economic progress and development.

This course explores the business issues in the design and operation of international transportation systems and underlines their strategic importance to firms and the economy. It draws upon the disciplines of operations management, decision analysis and transport economics to present a holistic view of the theories and practices of transportation management. The course also discusses the core concepts and terminologies of road, air, rail, sea and intermodal transportation, as well as the implications for contemporary supply chain management."
OPIM315,Shipping Logistics,"Global logistics and, in particular, shipping logistics have played a critical role in the growth and development of world trade and in the integration of manufacturing on a worldwide scale.  Today the international shipping industry is responsible for 90% of world trade.  Shipping is the lynchpin of the global economy. Without shipping, intercontinental trade, the bulk transport of raw materials, and the import/export of affordable food and manufactured goods would simply not be possible.  In fact, the standard container boxes are the bits and bytes that flow in today s international trade network. Shipping logistics catalyzes the international supply chain management which deals with the management of physical goods (raw materials, components, finished products), information (orders, status, contracts), and financial flows (payment, credits, etc.) in a network of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers.

This course examines the strategic role of shipping in global supply chains, and is an elective course which combines lectures, readings from the latest industry news, and case discussions. It exposes students to some real-industry managerial and business issues, useful conceptual frameworks, and practical analytical/quantitative models to equip them with the strategic logistics skills and the handles necessary to understand current developments in the logistics management of international shipping, as well as in the broader context of global supply chain management."
OPIM318,Sustainable Operations,"The objective of this course is to study how companies use their operations to improve environmental (and social) performance and contribute to business success at the same time. Many companies have started doing so by building sustainability into their operations. A focus on reducing environmental impact not only allows these companies to comply with increased regulations but also to reduce their costs, to improve the quality of their products, and to enhance the reputation of their brands. In addition, a new brand of companies is going beyond simply reducing negative externalities and actively tries to create a positive impact on the world.

In this course, students will learn how citizens, governments, customers, and employees are creating pressures for more sustainable development and how operations managers are responding to these pressures with waste reduction, pollution prevention, and product stewardship. Students will also study specific tools and methods such as environmental management systems, life cycle analysis, green buildings, green purchasing, design-for-environment, recycling, remanufacturing, servitization and industrial symbiosis. Through the course, students will also learn how to create a successful strategy for sustainable operations by incorporating sustainability considerations into business strategy, improvement planning, product and process design, supply management, risk management and both internal and external reporting systems."
OPIM319,Operations Strategy: Principles and Practice,"How did ZARA become one of the fastest growing and most profitable brands in fashion retailing?  How did Wal-Mart grow to be the world s largest retailer?  Largely the answer is that ZARA and Wal-Mart view their operational capabilities as an important and integral part of their competitive advantage.  As do other successful companies, such as Procter & Gamble, Toyota, and Coca Cola, they invest strategically in physical plants and facilities, in process and information technology, in employees, suppliers, and distributor relationships, and perhaps most importantly, in organizational practices and know-how.  The objective of this course is to provide students with a set of qualitative frameworks and quantitative tools to analyze and guide the long-term, strategic decisions for a company s operations function.

This course caters to those interested in management and business consulting, general management, and operations careers.  Finance specialists interested in assessing the risks, the opportunities, the competitive advantages, and ultimately the value embedded in a company s operations will benefit from the course as well."
OPIM321,Supply Chain Management,"Matching supply with demand is a primary challenge for a firm: excess supply is too costly, inadequate supply irritates customers. Matching supply to demand is easiest when a firm has a flexible supply process, but flexibility is generally expensive. In this course we will learn (1) how to assess the appropriate level of supply flexibility for a given industry and (2) explore strategies for economically increasing a firm s supply flexibility. Lastly we will study coordination and incentives across multiple firms in a supply chain. While tactical models and decisions are part of this course, the emphasis is on the qualitative insights needed by general managers or management consultants. We will demonstrate that companies can use (and have used) the principles from this course to significantly enhance their competitiveness."
OPIM322,High Performance Warehousing and Fulfillment,"As the world becomes more globalized many companies achieve competitive advantage by paying substantial attention on effective supply chain operations. Warehouses are consolidation hubs of various products in a supply chain. To support business that covers a wide range of markets it is common for a warehouse to store hundreds of thousands of products. These products pass through the warehouse in huge volume daily, and so it is important to run it efficiently.

Besides the traditional storage function, warehouses are increasingly forced to perform responsive and accurate customer order fulfillment and other value-added services. High performance in product warehousing and order fulfillment becomes crucial to the success of many companies in today's competitive business environment. We will introduce various operation models that are theoretically appealing and practically feasible. Some case studies will also be discussed.

This course is especially useful for those who are interested in consulting careers in logistics and supply chain management."
OPIM324,Global Supply Chains,"Global Supply Chain refers to the cross-border organization of the activities required to produce goods or services and bring them to consumers through inputs and various phases of development, production and delivery (International Labour Organization). As global trade is dependent on global supply chain, companies make investment decisions to globalize, setting up production facilities overseas and sales offices beyond their domestic market. The key aspects for companies embarking on global Supply Chain involves cross-border sourcing, overseas production, global planning and international distribution, where the various components for a final product could be sourced from different parts of the world, and manufactured at one or multiple locations and have them distributed to different markets.

Managing a global supply chain is also no longer about driving down cost, but it is how companies can maintain their competitiveness and global supply chains has never been more challenging and disruptive in the current environment of pandemic and geo-political tensions. In addition, e-commerce has also changed the design for global supply chain as well. This course provides students with a practical lens and frameworks regarding global supply chain. Students learn the key concepts on global supply chain management, together with special topics on maritime logistics, technology and green supply chain that affects the development of global supply chain. Understanding them would enable the students to better appreciate the complexities when handling global supply chain activities in future.

Topics covered include: considerations for global sourcing, selection criteria for global production locations, planning in an uncertainty, volatility, complexity and ambiguity environment, various international methods of entry to overseas market, e-commerce distribution, incoterms and different modes of transportation, terms of payment, customs requirements, and maritime distribution network. Business cases and real-life examples will be used in the course. Industry speakers will be invited as guest lecturers to share the challenges and practical solutions relating to global supply chain. This course is highly relevant for the current business environment and is recommended for those interested in working for global companies managing cross-border business."
OPIM325,Sales and Operations Planning,"According to the well-established SCOR framework, planning is a major process block in any supply chain. In today s environment, the importance of business planning is magnified by globalization (and thus more complex supply chains), volatility of demand, and ever more demanding customers. Planning activities and tasks cut across the entire organization, and this course offers an approach to integrating all stakeholders  inputs and driving decisions to deliver superior results for the company and a higher level of customer service.

The course offers a holistic understanding of S&OP, drilling into the key building blocks of the process (demand planning, supply planning,  ), the stakeholders and KPIs. It also covers the technology available to support the process and discuss the approach to implement such a process in any company. Besides the theoretical foundation, the course brings several opportunities for hands-on experience via case studies, business simulation games and industry practitioner sharing sessions.

The Sales and Operations Planning course will equip students with sound knowledge of planning processes in a company and how they drive the bottom-line results. This course is recommended to students with career ambitions in business planning, operations planning, consulting and general management."
OPIM326,Service and Operations Analytics,"The increasing availability of data is changing the way organizations are thinking about themselves and the way they interact with the world. Data is helping improve the profits of businesses, the quality of life of individuals, the performance of sports teams, and social interactions. In this course you will learn how to use data and analytics to improve the service and operations of the organisations. The course will expose students to real world examples of how analytics is being used from various domains in managing operations and service delivery, e.g., product quality control, revenue management. Through these examples you will learn how to use tools of analytics such as linear regression, logistic regression, classification and regression trees, random forests, clustering, optimization, and visualization techniques in practice. The statistical software R will be used in the course, and class demo will be presented in R Notebooks. Students are encouraged to create their assignment and project reports using R Notebooks."
OPIM331,Computer Simulation,"Computer simulation is a popular tool used by managers to analyze and understand complex systems. These systems can be an existing or a proposed facility that is too complex for traditional analytical tools. In this course, students will learn how to model business systems using commercial simulation software and to analyze and interpret the results.

This is a computer simulation programming course. Students are taught simulation through practices by building simulation models. The instructor will build and review some simulation models in class. Students are then expected to build their own simulation models. The success of this course will depend on the student s personal involvement in making simulation a reality."
OPIM340,Retail Operations,"This interactive course studies the important and complex field of retail operations, focusing on the analytical aspects of retail management. As global retailers seek to expand in Asia, there is an urgent need for managers with a strong analytical foundation in operations and an understanding of the cultural aspects of the region.
Singapore is undeniably a retail powerhouse, offering a plethora of international brand retail outlets, complemented by distinctive boutiques highlighting regional designers. However, the Internet and social media have redrawn the battle lines in retail, forcing companies to scramble to keep ahead in the highly competitive and volatile global markets. The retail industry drives innovations in operations, as retailers compete globally for increasingly discriminating customers and as the supply chain is stretched across continents. Hence, this course facilitates students in learning about retail operations in the Singapore context."
OPIM341,Procurement and Strategic Sourcing,"In today s increasingly competitive and globalized world, firms are trying to find ways to improve their performance and differentiate themselves from their rivals. Clearly, suppliers can have great impact on a firm s total cost and help in this differentiation process. Increased levels of outsourcing and offshoring make correct selection of suppliers and their quality, along with development of relationships between suppliers and producers, more crucial than ever. Whatever the supplier provides, the effective organization needs a robust system to procure the correct goods and services at the best possible price for the organization. Once the organization has made the decision to procure goods and services from another organization, both organizations must clearly define the parameters of the relationship. This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the impact that sourcing and supply management has on the success and profitability of firms in today s business environment. This course will expose students to concepts and principles in strategic sourcing as pursued by leading edge firms. It will generate student interest in pursuing sourcing as a viable career opportunity, be it in retailing, manufacturing, government agencies or non-profit organizations. The course will provide applied learning opportunities in strategic sourcing through a combination of lectures, case analyses, and group exercises."
OPIM342,Operational Risk Management,"All organizations bear operational risks in order to achieve their objectives. Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss from operation failure.  Compared to other types of risk, such as credit, underwriting, and innovation risk, operational risk is perhaps the most fundamental and significant one. Why? Operational risk is highly asymmetrical in nature, because of the potential for very large losses due to extreme events (though these are usually few in number). Precisely because extreme events are so rare relative to other risk types, they are very difficult to assess. For organizations motivated by profit, a net positive return is required by shareholders. Operational risk therefore is a key concern of both internal and external stakeholders.

The course will give students an overview of which operational risks are prevalent in various industries and what tools and techniques can be used to identify, quantify and control operational risks. Besides learning the basics of probability and statistical theories, students will become familiar with the risk analysis framework and will conduct a risk analysis using either Oracle s Crystal Ball software or @Risk from Palisade. Students will also be introduced to various regulatory requirements."
OPIM343,Port-Focal Logistics and Maritime Operations,"As much as 90% of world trade is carried via maritime transportation. A wide range of cargoes, each with their own specific handling and storage requirements, pass through the world s ports and terminals every day. Port operations is a complicated business dealing with a number of disparate activities such as the movement of ships, containers, and other cargo, the loading and unloading of ships and containers, and customs activities. Efficient port operations are important to ensure the smooth transition of cargoes, so that these cargoes reach their destination on time.

This course introduces the functions of ports and their roles in contemporary logistics. With the intermodal advancements that lead to expanded but overlapping hinterlands, ports face competitive pressure. This course equips students with knowledge on port operations and how ports can provide value in the modern supply chain. The inter-related relationship among shipping lines, stevedores, port operators and the regulatory environment is discussed."
OPIM344,Sustainable Shipping and Ports,"International shipping and ports are fundamental to the achievement of world sustainable development. However, the challenges to shipping and ports in providing safe, secure, energy efficient, environmentally and climate friendly services that, at the same time, promote connectivity and trade and enables economic growth are complex and tremendous. These challenges call for a multi-stakeholder approach involving shipping companies, port authorities/port development companies, regulators, financial institutions, research institutions, and other relevant partners. This course addresses the sustainability imperative for shipping and ports and the various solutions that are available to the different industry stakeholders. Indeed, the shipping and ports industries have started to respond to the growing environmental and social concerns of regulators, customers and the local communities in which they operate, while at the same time increasingly recognizing that sustainability may provide for new business opportunities and profitability."
OPIM346,Operations and Supply Chain Management in Healthcare,"Given the trend of an aging population and rising healthcare costs in many countries around the world, it is important for healthcare service providers to minimise the costs of service delivery while maintaining high quality of health care services, patient satisfaction, safety and other important outcome measures. This course presents elementary operations management and supply chain management principles before applying them to the healthcare sector. Those topics include, but are not limited to, process optimization, capacity management, logistics, queuing, scheduling, and many more. The application of the operations management tools and methods needs to be tailored to the healthcare context, which the students will explore through a mix of case study discussions and guest speakers.
The students will also independently explore an emerging topic in healthcare from an operations management perspective to gain a better understanding of future challenges and opportunities in this industry."
OPIM347,Shipping Strategies  The Digital Dimensions,"What makes shipping strategies sustainable? In this course we go beyond the CSR-agenda and regard shipping strategies from a broader E2SG-inspired perspective including economical, environmental, social and political dimensions. The fundamemtal idea of the course is that digitalization is fueling a transformation of the maritime eco-system  including new and altered relations between shipping companies and customers, competitors, authorities and sea/shore based employees. We focus on the future role of digitalization as a critical component in the present and future of the maritime sector, not only in a technological manner but also as a strategic, cultural and political enabler of change. The course will be centered around three fundamental questions:
1) How can sustainable strategies be developed and excuted when international shipping is transformed by digitalization?
2) Which role does digitalization play in the formation and execution of sustainable strategies and business models?
3) How and why does digitalization affect various shipping segments in different ways?"
OPIM348,Supply Chain Analytics,"The increasing availability of data is changing the way a supply chain is managed.  Supply chain analytics is where data analytics meet supply chain management.  Given the conflicting objectives of efficiency and customer satisfaction, data-driven analysis can be useful in achieving supply chain excellence.  In this course, you will learn the analytics tools and skills to diagnose and optimize a supply chain. In particular, you will learn how statistical tools and data-based optimization can help supply chain stay competitive and attain its leadership."
OPIM602,Quantitative Methods for Investment Analysis,"This course builds up the quantitative skills of participants to compute and understand the methodology of forecasting, advanced financial analysis and valuation of complex securities, including derivatives. Topics will include probability theory, decision trees analysis, hypothesis testing, and simple statistical analysis such as correlation and covariances, regression analysis and time series analysis."
OPIM603,Optimization Models for Business Operations,"This course teaches the students how to formulate and solve deterministic optimization models, including linear, integer, nonlinear, network and dynamic programming problems.  The students will learn to use appropriate computer modeling languages to solve exercises and applications from the business world.  The objective of the course is to endow the students with complete command over a set of tools that can be used in business operations.  This includes knowing how to formulate an optimization problem, how to solve that problem using computer modeling languages, which analytical theories and computational methods underlie the solution procedure, and how to interpret the result and its sensitivity analysis."
OPIM604,Stochastic Models for Business Operations,"This is a foundation course in applied stochastic processes with emphasis on modeling real life phenomena with probabilistic reasoning, especially relating to operations management.  Over the past several decades, stochastic models have proven to be highly effective in optimizing the use of resources within many areas in business. These models use some basic building blocks from probability theory and stochastic processes to model decision problems under uncertainty related to business operations.  Researchers in operations management have actively contributed to these models for a wide variety of applications.  There are also other areas and disciplines where stochastic processes have great use.  Topics to be covered include a review of elementary probability theory with particular attention to conditional expectation; the Poisson process, and Markov processes.  Applications to operations management especially involving queuing, reliability, and inventory will be discussed."
OPIM605,Advanced Business Processes,"This course offers concepts and techniques to structure, manage, and improve a firm's recurring business processes. We will cover both theoretical models as well as practical examples. The content of the course is applicable to banks, grocery stores, and hospitals, for example, as to traditional manufacturing. This course is essential to students aspiring to become consultants, entrepreneurs, general managers, or academic researchers. They will learn how to manage the business processes of a firm, and how these processes affect and are affected by their business decisions. This is also a foundation course that prepares students to do rigorous academic research in Operations Management."
OPIM606,Supply Chain Management,"The objective of this course is to provide students with state-of-the-art models, concepts, and methods for designing, operating and managing supply chains. Topics covered will range from basic topics such as inventory management, logistics network design, distribution system to more advanced topics such as strategic alliances, value of information in supply chain, information technology, decision support systems and international issues in supply chains."
OPIM608,Research Topics in Operations Management,"The objective of this course is to introduce master s students to the state-of-the-art research in operations management (OM), to provide a forum to communicate research ideas between OM faculty and students, and to initiate master s students to formulate and analyze a research problem that eventually may extend to master s dissertation. Besides the faculty oriented research topics, selected analytical modeling tools will be introduced in the course, which include economic order quantity model and different variants of newsvendor problem."
OPIM609,Stochastic Processes with Business Applications,"This course begins by demonstrating the need for probabilistic analyses of managerial decision making under uncertainty. Coverage will include a brief review of probability concepts, elements of Markov chains, waiting lines (queues), and probabilistic dynamic programming. Practical applications of these topics to operations management problems will be emphasized by employing the Excel spreadsheet software."
OPIM610,Advanced Management Science,"This course covers some advanced mathematical and computing techniques to solve problems in business operations. It equips students with the necessary skills to do rigorous research in operations management. Possible topics covered by this course include dynamic programming, Markov decision process, game theory, heuristics, dynamical systems, and simulation."
OPIM611,Revenue Management,"This seminar covers both theory and practice of revenue management (RM). RM has gained attention recently as one of the most successful application areas of operations research. Both academic and industrial research on methodology of RM has grown rapidly. This seminar provides students analytical training in both operations research and economics. It also gives students a qualitative understanding of the business context, such as airlines, hotel chains, and car rental companies."
OPIM614,Supply Chain Management,"Broadly speaking, this course is about developing an understanding of what exactly supply chains do, and how they function. More importantly, our particular focus will be on uncovering hidden sources of value in supply chains, and how such value creation enables new companies to quickly grow and dominate their markets.  Companies like Wal-mart, Dell, Zara, and Li & Fung are first and foremost, as their own executives frequently mention in the media, in the supply chain business. Recognizing untapped business opportunities has allowed those companies not just to develop very fast and become industry leaders, but also to set new industry standards and benchmarks when it comes to supply chain management. Closer to home, we ll discuss how one Singapore company went from zero to $500M in revenues in just five years, based on a single idea on how to improve supply chain efficiency.

This course will introduce and utilize key tactics such as risk pooling and inventory placement, such as integrated planning and collaboration. It will delve into powerful supply chain levers such as incentives and information sharing.  Particular course objectives include:

1. Identify key supply chain issues and challenges
2. Understand the role of uncertainty and risk in supply chains
3. Learn about different tools to manage risk
4. Become familiar with differing incentives in supply chains
5. Develop an understanding of alternative incentive structures
6. Know about the function of inventory in supply chains
7. Appreciate different strategies used by companies to improve supply chain performance"
OPIM616,Business Value of Digital Disruptions - CXO Perspectives,"Successful orchestration of planning and execution processes across virtual and global networks is a critical success factor for today s businesses. This necessitates tight information integration across business functions and a strong alignment between the business and Information Technology functions. However, in reality, there is a distinct misalignment between these two functions, and a relative lack of understanding of the value that digital technologies can bring in form of top-line and bottom-line impacts. As the scale of digital investments grow and new disruptive technologies such as Big Data, Analytics, IoT, AI, Cloud and Social Media gain prominence, executives need to understand this  rift  better, align Digital strategy with business strategy, and assess, in clear terms, the tangible and non-tangible benefits that digital technologies can bring.

The focus of this course is to critically understand and evaluate the above topics. This is an integrative course that connects business strategy, process analysis, digital apability development requirements, capital budgeting, project management and change management concepts to develop a clear framework and process for discovering the value potential of digitalization and ensuring value realization from investments in digital technologies."

OPIM622A,Project Management,"Project management is a key component of strategy implementation. Analysts are keenly aware of this and closely monitor the performance of key projects when they evaluate companies. Also, in the knowledge-based economy, projects are responsible for a large proportion of value generation and many traditional organizations are being transformed into  project-based-organizations.  As a result, general managers need to understand project management best practice, not only because they may oversee important projects but also because they need to be good  consumers  of projects.
This course provides an overview of project management best practice. We will use the first three sessions of the course to summarize the  traditional  project management techniques learned over the last 30 years. We will then discuss different management approaches for different kinds of projects, with different priorities and different levels of uncertainty. Finally we will examine how companies organize projects in collaboration with suppliers.
This course is targeted at managers who need to lead or oversee important and challenging business projects. The course is not focused on technical project management, but rather on the organizational issues surrounding it. The course combines cases, exercises, simulations lectures, and discussions, using relevant observations and experiences of the students in the class."

PHIL101,Philosophy,"This course is an introduction to philosophical analysis. Its aim is to invite students to examine critically some of their most fundamental (and largely unconscious) beliefs about knowledge, the world, and morality, and to determine to what extend they are justified. Philosophy is best experienced live. Students are therefore strongly encouraged not merely to read and learn what others say, but also to think for themselves and to use rational arguments to develop their own positions. A high level of class participation is expected from every student."
PHIL203,Philosophy of Religion,"This course introduces key themes in the philosophy of religion. After distinguishing philosophical approaches to religion from other ways of understanding religion, the course focuses upon the traditional heart of the philosophy of religion, namely, philosophical theology. Along with other subjects, philosophical theology studies (1) arguments for and against the existence of God and (2) what attributes any divine being, if there be such, must possess. Standards of proof within philosophical theology are discussed, followed by a brief overview of the traditional understanding of the divine attributes. The remainder of the course divides into two parts. In the first part we examine a variety of arguments that philosophers have advanced for God s existence. In the second part we consider the strongest family of arguments against the existence of God, namely arguments against the existence of God based on the presence of evil in the universe."
PHIL204,Theory of Knowledge,"""Knowledge management' and ""knowledge-based economy"" are buzz-words that now enjoy a wide currency. But what really is knowledge? Is it simply true belief? Or must the true belief also be justified? If knowledge involves justified true belief, what do belief, truth and justification amount to? Do we really know what we take ourselves as knowing? Or are the skeptics correct when they argue that we know nothing or almost nothing? Could we be brains in vats in a sunny laboratory, wired to a machine that feeds us the indistinguishable experience of watching the rain fall? How could we best respond to such skeptics? What are the sources of knowledge? How do perception, reflection, memory and prediction give us knowledge? Can we really ever know the shape of the future? How is knowledge acquired and transmitted?"
PHIL205,Political Philosophy,"The main aim of this course is to introduce you to the study of Political Philosophy including the critical study of some of the Classical and Modern Moral Theorists and their work.  This should compliment the more particular units of study in the Political Science Major. We will explore the specific notion of political legitimacy in both an historical and thematic manner. Students are expected to demonstrate understanding of crucial themes in political philosophy and the logic of political discourse, including the various levels of justification of political judgments and political belief systems."
PLE100,Interdisciplinary Perspectives and Methods,"In this course, students will each start a PLE program portfolio that will document their reflections on what they intend to achieve in their interdisciplinary major specifically and in their SMU career, and provide a framework within which to plan their choice of courses, to monitor and review of their own progress. This portfolio will help them communicate their undergraduate accomplishments (especially its interdisciplinary aspects) to others.This course provides Politics-Law-Economics majors the opportunity to explore the concept of interdisciplinarity, why and how interdisciplinary perspectives contribute to our understanding and capacity for solving problems in the real world. It will prepare students to integrate what they learn from different disciplines. Students will learn what is involved in an interdisciplinary research process. The course will also introduce core methodological concepts and different techniques used in empirical research in the social sciences.

Students will submit their final thesis report two weeks before the oral defense of the thesis to the supervisor and appointed co-examiner. The oral defense will typically be held on Week 14 of the second term."
POSC003,Introduction to Political and Policy Studies,"This course provides an introduction to the major theories, ideas, concepts, and issues in political science and public policy studies.  Topics may include but are not restricted to distribution, fairness and justice as they relate to politics and policies.  Understanding politics and public policies is crucial for participation in modern society. This course facilitates this understanding by discussing crucial questions such as why states go to war, why some states have become democratic while others have not, how does culture affect politics, and why various countries are ruled in such different ways."
POSC101,Introduction to Public Policy,"This course introduces students to the conceptual and pragmatic skills necessary for analyzing and devising public policy. On the one hand, the course exposes students to the methods and concepts that make up the tool-box of the contemporary policy analyst. On the other hand, by using these tools to make sense of real-life policy issues and political processes in South-East Asia and elsewhere, the course also introduces students to the more pragmatic  craft  aspects of producing incisive analysis relevant to policy actors in real policy-making environments."
POSC103,World Politics,"The objective of the course is twofold. The course aims to provide students with a broad understanding of the major schools of international relations and to place these theories into the larger historical context. Building on this, also provides a brief survey of the major international state and non-state  practices  (structures, processes, and agents) before moving on to the discussion of some of the most salient international issues of today and the future."
POSC106,International Political Economy,"In the past few decades, the international economy has undergone drastic changes.  Most significantly, distance and borders have become less of an obstacle to production, trade and the movement of money than ever before, a set of changes that is usually summed up by the term  globalization .  While the gains from globalization have been considerable, it has also yielded a number of problems and raised several critical issues.  The aim of this course is to examine the causes, correlates, and consequences of globalization as they relate to political economies.  We will also ask more specific questions such as the changing role of the state in the face of globalization, the maintenance of order in an increasingly complex global economic system, and the use of political power for national economic gain."
POSC108,Mass Media and Public Opinion Research,"The mass media constitutes an important sphere through which we can understand our complex political and social world. Why does the media focus on certain issues, give voice to particular actors, and frame stories in particular ways? And consequently, how does the media affect public opinion and behavior. Does the media foster understanding, insight, and hold the powerful to account, or does it spread discord, misinformation, and maintain power hierarchies? These are the kinds of questions that students can find answers to in this project-based research design course. During the course students will learn how to write a rigorous empirical research paper and develop the methodological skills to survey public opinion and systematically code media content. After studying how to plan a content analysis and public opinion survey, students will work in groups and write a research proposal on a topic of their choosing. Potential topics are wide ranging. For instance, they could relate to elections, identity politics, migration, protest, conflict, as well as economic, business, environmental, health, or educational issues. Students then choose to design a survey or a content analysis. For the survey, students develop a questionnaire plan to gather public opinions on the media or preform a survey experiment to understand the impact of media. Students doing a content analysis will develop a codebook to code newspapers, TV, film, social media, or the web. After analyzing their unique data, student projects culminate in a presentation and an original research paper of approximately 9,000 words."
POSC202,"The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, 1500 to Present","Packing more than five hundred years of great power relations into 14 weeks, this course stretches from the discovery of America in 1492 to the post-9/11 world of the 21st century. It looks at the larger historical patterns and the  soft  and  hard  factors leading to the rise or decline of the great powers, yet also emphasises the role of human leadership in their making or breaking."
POSC203,Comparing Political Systems,"The comparative study provides us with a ready array of conceptual and analytical tools that we can use to address and answer a wider range of questions about the political-economic-social world. This course is intended to acquaint students with some important classic and contemporary works on selected problems and issues in the field of comparative politics, which is one of the main subfields of political research. What can we learn through comparisons that we would be unable to from the study of political systems one by one? Why compare, and how? These questions should be in the forefront of this course. Topics include critical comparative methods, political power, political institutions (executive, legislative, judiciary, and bureaucracy), capitalism, globalization, and federalism in developed and developing countries."
POSC206,Politics of Japan and Korea,"This course introduces students to politics and public policies in contemporary Japan and Korea. Japan was the first non-Western country to industrialize and to establish the democratic institutions. However, unlike most Western democracies, Japan maintained a mixture of democratic procedures, one-party dominance, alliance with U.S. military, high-level of economic growth, and social security from 1955 to 1993. Since to early 1993, many of mainstays of the previous system have collapsed and new institutions have established: coalition government, electoral reform, the bubble economy, etc. Following the experience of  Japanese miracle,  the second half of the twentieth century has seen South Korea transformed from an impoverished, war-ravaged nation to one of the most successful economies in East Asian region. This has been accompanied by a political transformation from a military authoritarian regime to a vibrant democracy. While most analyses of Korean politics have looked to elites to explain political change, this course is designed to examine new challenges to political power structure of Korea in the age of transformation."
POSC208,Security Studies,"This course introduces main theoretical debates and contemporary issues in international security. It begins by examining different perspectives on war and military power and then see how they help better understand four case studies the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the two Gulf Wars. We will analyse why these wars occurred, how they might have been avoided or taken different courses, participants  military strategy and performance, and why they ended the way they did. The following sections cover selected traditional topics in security studies, ranging from alliances, sanctions, nuclear proliferation, to energy security. Students will be introduced key texts of each topic and encouraged to critically engage on how, why, when, and to whom these issue-areas affect international security. The last part of the course address emerging challenges in international security today. Here, the focus is on identifying key factors, conditions, and questions of new security challenges, selectively applying the insights we have learnt until then, and producing informed judgment about their likely impact in the future."

The course explores the main public policies of the European Union. It also looks at the diverse foreign policies of the European Union: the public policies of the EU, its external relations, as well as co-operation in justice and home affairs and its external ramifications."
POSC215,Democracy,"This course is an introduction to democracy, the most common regime type in the world today. It begins with core debates in the study of democracy: how to define democracy, why some countries democratize and others remain authoritarian, and why democracies sometimes break down. It then covers key features of democratic systems such as parties, elections, and legislatures, and examines how political institutions, social cleavages, and economic inequality influence the democratic process. The course draws on evidence from a wide range of countries in the developed and developing world. Course readings will be supplemented with cases and material drawn from current events."
POSC216,Politics and Society of India,"India is on the move. Sixty years after attaining its independence, India's growing economic and military power has begun to attract the world's attention. But in its quest to become the next great power, India must also surmount enormous political, cultural and social hurdles. This course aims to understand both these aspects of modern India -- its promise and its challenges. The course introduces students to basic principles, concepts and ideas associated with the study of India including democracy, federalism, religion, caste, constitution, multiculturalism, foreign policy and economic reform and development."
POSC217,Corporate Responsibility in the Global Era,"The traditional division of labor among business, government, and civil society saw corporations seeking profits, governments regulating corporations, and civil society groups agitating for changes in governmental regulation.  Globalization, privatization, and changing ideas about the roles of business and government have blurred this division. In this new world, corporations increasingly deliver essential services and meet basic public needs, exert heavy influence over public policy and find that their consumers and investors hold them directly accountable for their effects on the environment and on human rights. This course examines how business, government, and society are responding to the changing landscape and explores the options that leaders now face, from rethinking business models to changing notions of governance. It focuses on the drivers for and obstacles to change, the different roles played by companies, governments, civil society, institutional investors and social entrepreneurs in shaping current approaches, and a sense of what the future may hold, particularly in Asia."
POSC218,Global Political Economy,"Globalization is often associated with intensified cross-national flows of capital, commodities, and labor that elude state control and integrate local economies into global networks of production and trade.  This module examines the manifold dimensions of the global economy along three theoretical axes. First, the specific historical form of the global economy under study is  capitalism,  understood as not only an economic system of material production, distribution, and consumption but also a political order of power, authority, and legitimacy   in other words, a global political economy. Second, in analysing capitalism, we adopt a long historical view that traces the emergence of its fundamental logics and global expanse back to the eighteenth century. Third, we pay special attention to political and legal frameworks other than the nation-state, especially early-modern colonial empires, modern imperialism, and their institutional and ideological legacies that have endured into the post-war international regimes of production, trade, and development.

The aim is to provide a perspective on the political and historical dimensions of the global economy that is as multi-disciplinary as possible. Lectures and readings present material from international relations, economics, political science, history, sociology, anthropology, and geography. Although concepts and theories from economics and international political economy are central to this module, this is decidedly not a course in either international economics or the politics of economic relations among states. It is an investigation into a wider variety of forms and facets of politics as they pertain to the wide range of actors participating in the global economy."
POSC219,Political Theory,"This course offers a historical overview of the debates over cardinal political categories, such as power, authority, rule, legitimacy, freedom, equality, and justice. We will survey the history of political thinking in Europe, mainly because a global capitalist economy and the dissemination of the modern state form in the postwar period beyond Europe makes the political and social categories articulated in the Western tradition applicable to non-European contexts. Each week, we will concentrate on primary texts by canonical thinkers ranging from Plato to Foucault. In discussing the works of individual political philosophers, our objective is not to study each thinker s thought for its own sake but to investigate the fundamental concepts and questions they brought to the fore. We will regularly ground the abstract ideas we examine in empirical phenomena, both past and present. This enterprise will involve textual interpretation and critical reflection in order to systematically scrutinize what we mean by  politics,  where we draw the boundaries of the  political,  and how we interrelate different political concepts and schemes."
POSC220,International Relations of East Asia,"This course offers a basic overview of major trends and issues in international relations of East Asia. In particular, it analyzes various sources of tensions as well as opportunities for cooperation in the region, thereby opening up discussions about major factors that are likely to be relevant in shaping the region's future."
POSC221,Politics of the Two Koreas,"This course examines actors, processes, and issues in the contemporary Korean politics, focusing on the following questions: what accounts for the divergent paths that the two Koreas took in economic development and political institutionalization since 1945? What is a way forward for its nuclear crisis? What are the latest political, economic, and cultural challenges for the two Koreas?"
POSC222,Chinese Foreign Policy,"This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Chinese foreign policy. We analyze important historical periods in Chinese foreign relations, the sources, actors, and processes in Chinese foreign policy making, China s relations with various countries and regions, Chinese policy toward key functional issues in international affairs, how the rise of China is affecting global power relations, and how other actors are responding. The course pays attention to the application of international relations theories, and also takes an interest in policy issues facing decision-makers in China and other countries who deal with China."
POSC223,Political Economy of Inequality in Singapore,"Former US president Obama called rising inequality the defining challenge of our time. Beyond its normative implications, the degree of inequality within and between communities, and the dynamics that shape this, has a disproportionately influence over whether economies, and the societies that make them, flourish or perish.  

This course draws on works from multiple disciplines to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the political and economic drivers - and consequences - of economic inequality. While theories and examples are drawn from a variety of contexts , Singapore will be the main focus of discussion and application for all topics. In addition, two weeks are exclusively dedicated to review the state of inequality in Singapore, what is being done about it, and how we might do better."
POSC304,Parties and Social Movements,"Political parties and social movements are instruments of political participation. The purpose of the course is to discuss how people participate in the political process, what factors trigger or constrain participation. The core of the course will examine how interests and rights are articulated in the political arena."
POSC306,Special Topics in Political Science,"This is a special topic course and the selected topic, which may vary from year to year, will be taught based on the research expertise of the instructor.  The course will provide students an opportunity to have a more in-depth understanding of selected issues in political science."
POSC307,Political Science Study Mission,"Unifying theory and practice, the Political Science Study Mission allows students to examine the effects of politics on the political, economic and social life of a foreign country through direct exposure. In addition to regular classroom education in Singapore, participants will visit a foreign country to study specific political topics in their context, and apply social science research methods. The pre-study mission preparatory sessions will lay the foundation for the components of the course that will be carried out in the visited country and allow students to discuss current research on the visited country s political system. Within this context, Political Science Study Missions adopt various approaches, including guided visits to a country s political institutions, group interviews with political actors, and intensive fieldwork within specific localities, to name a few."
POSC308,Gender Politics: Exclusion and Empowerment,"This course explores the ways in which the social and cultural construction of gender influences the nature and practice of politics. The course revolves around two themes   exclusion and empowerment   and examines the practices, policies and structures that exclude different genders, as well as the strategies and repertoires of different gendered communities to protect their rights and interests. Using case studies in development and specific experiences within countries, as well as lessons from practitioners, the course outlines how gender shapes political life."
POSC309,Intervention and Justice in International Relations,"International intervention, particularly since the end of the Cold War, is often said to expose a conflict between order and justice. This course is concerned with the evolution of intervention in the historical norms and rules of states, with a focus on debates occurring in and around the United Nations. In addition to assessing the changing character of international society, we will consider the moral and political adequacy of existing institutions. When, if ever, is it justified to wage war against another country? To what extent should international organisations promote and encourage respect for human rights? What is a just and equitable global economic and information order? How much force should peacekeepers be allowed to use? Should powerful countries be allowed to interfere in the internal affairs of smaller states?"
POSC310,"Development, Underdevelopment and Poverty","Global economic growth over the past few centuries has brought unprecedented prosperity to more people than ever before. Despite this, many nations remain desperately poor, with more than one billion people unable to support themselves and their families and a reported 18 million poverty-related deaths worldwide each year. This course, applying a variety of perspectives, focuses on the relationship between development and poverty to ask: Why does poverty exist? What is its relationship with economic and political development? What are effective ways to reduce rural and urban poverty?"
POSC313,Political Science Study Mission to Europe,"The Study Mission to Europe consists of a ten-day course in Europe providing an introduction to European integration and comparative regional integration studies. Launched and conducted by Dr Clara Portela, the Study Mission takes SMU students to Europe, where they attend seminars, visit institutions and heritage sites alongside a group of students from local Universities. The first three editions of the Study Mission featured trips to Brussels, Luxembourg, Strassburg, Frankfurt, Trier and Saarbr cken. The Study Mission helps students acquire a good understanding of the EU, while it allows them to network with European peers and to follow seminars with top experts and practitioners."
POSC314,Global Issues and Institutions,"The world is awash in problems that do not respect national borders, from economic instability to climate change to prospects for new global pandemics.  Experts warn that global shortages of food, water, and energy will become the norm, intensifying the prospects for conflict around the world. Yet this new global era is still governed by mutually suspicious countries motivated primarily by short-term national self-interest. This course examines the practical side of managing the global agenda. It addresses key questions: In the absence of an unlikely, and probably undesirable, world government, who makes and enforces global rules that could help humanity resolve these conundrums? Given the much-heralded rise of Asia, what roles are Asian governments (including Singapore) playing in these institutions, and should they do things differently? The course is highly interactive and puts a premium on student-led sessions.

No pre-requisites. However, students are strongly recommended to complete at least one International Relations course such as World Politics, International Political Economics, or International Organisations before enrolling for this course."
POSC315,Human Rights in International Relations,"The course covers major theories and practices of human rights in politics and international relations. It is to 1) teach the multidisciplinary methodology from political science and international law, 2) familiarize students with the main literature and debates in international human rights and 3) help students critically think and analyse various contentious human rights issues in international politics. Each seminar introduces one topic in human rights in international relations and lead students  individual oral presentations on critical review of their chosen articles or book chapters which are from the course pack. The seminar is also designed to use the knowledge and international human rights law into regional or domestic contexts by simulating model United Nations or regional human rights mechanisms."
POSC316,The Politics of Water in Asia,"The control of water matters. From agricultural production to fishing to national security, water is political. As population centers shift toward urban centers, international demands on water expand, food prices increase, and climate changes alter weather patterns, this precious, limited resource will only become more contentious in the future.

In this course we examine the underlying political issues that shape water management and the policies that governments make to deal with them. We will begin with domestic water issues, such as water management for food security, before turning to international water conflicts, like those brewing over the Mekong River and the Spratly Islands. In doing so, we will engage with theories of common pool resource management, policy making, and international relations. Most of our readings will focus on Southeast Asian cases."
POSC317,Special Projects with International Organisations,"This course is designed to provide students with both advanced research skills and practical experiences through a joint research project with international organisations. Students learn to develop assigned contemporary research agendas and to write progressively research proposals, drafts, revisions, and final papers under close academic supervision by the instructor while working with international organisations in Asia including UN agencies, embassies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as their  project  interns. Throughout the term, students are closely supervised by the instructor on how to conduct primary research and write a research paper while regularly meeting or communicating, online and offline, with the practice supervisor at the hosting institution to report their progress and receive feedback. Such research opportunities will enable students to critically analyse contemporary international affairs in Asia, evaluate existing public policies and propose realistic policy recommendations to the hosting institution. This innovative course gives students a unique opportunity to be exposed to international working environments by proactively facilitating interactive learning by doing beyond classroom."
POSC318,Global Migration and Human Security,"Global migration is one of the interdisciplinary areas of study from political science, human geography, law, economics, sociology, anthropology and social work. There is growing correlation between cross-border migration and human security. This course introduces theories of migration and security from the multidisciplinary perspectives as well as international organisations and national governments that deal with transnational migration before the class moves onto country-specific research projects in comparative aspects in Asia. Through this course, students conduct research projects under the instructor s academic supervision with international institutions such as the International Organisation for Migration, the United Nations Inter-Agency Project on Human Trafficking, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the Asia-Pacific region."
POSC319,Political Economy of Development,"Development continues to be a major goal of most countries. Although it can be measured in a variety of ways, the most common criterion is that of economic growth. Our study will focus primarily on economic growth, but we will also discuss other dimensions, including equality, education, health, and gender. While we often think of it in reference to middle and low income countries, development remains desirable for all people. This is because the main impetus for development   a better life   is universal.
In this class we investigate the role of politics on development. Our primary focus will be on how interests and institutions (i.e.  political economy ) impact development. We will discuss institutions such as regime type, electoral systems, as well as bureaucracies and how they shape the incentives necessary to encourage growth."
POSC320,Elections and Media,"Elections have become a global phenomena and are arguably the most fundamental aspect of democracy. Around the world, more and more people are voting and engaging with election campaigns through the media. This course explores the impact of electoral campaigns, and specifically the role the mass media plays within them, on voters. How do election campaigns unfold through the media? Why do people vote the way they do? How does the media and campaign advertising affect voting behavior? Taking a comparative perspective, examples of elections are drawn from the US, Latin America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Besides traditional forms of media, it examines the impact of websites, social networking sites, and political blogs on elections and on efforts to foster democracy. Course readings will be supplemented with documentary films and clips of televised campaign advertising."
POSC321,Politics of Food Security,"In this class we investigate the politics behind food security. We will be looking at both the international and national determinants of the availability of food and the inputs necessary for food production (land, water, seeds, fertilizers, fuels). In doing so, we will study both countries that export food and those that rely on food imports; the cases will draw from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Our primary focus will be on politics that shape government policies determining food production, availability, and cost. The course should give you a greater personal appreciation for how politics affects the price you pay for food every day."
POSC323,"Politics, Philosophy, and Economics","This course aims to promote critical thinking about the idea of the  economy.  In our everyday lives, we intuitively treat the economy as an all-encompassing yet obscure reality, as we believe its workings can be grasped only by economists who speak its specialized, technical language. We will problematize this view of the economy through a historical survey of Western social thought on central economic concepts and questions, such as property, exchange, labor, production, distribution, and consumption. This historical perspective reveals that economic problems are never purely economic but have always been entwined with political issues and ethical judgments. As we examine a range of social and political theories by situating them in their historical contexts, we will analyze how questions of power, authority, and legitimacy, and conceptions of good life have been central to various definitions of the economy. We will see that processes of production and consumption, and institutions of property and markets are invariably implicated in profound controversies about justice, fairness, freedom, and equality. Grappling with diverse approaches to the economy, some of which are wildly different than today s dominant theories, is intended to cultivate a critical distance toward our tacit assumptions and broaden the scope of questions we can ask about prevailing economic structures and processes."
POSC324,Media and International Relations,"This course covers the functions, principles, theories, and methods used for understanding the role of media and public opinion in international politics and foreign policy. It explores the triangular relationship between the state, the media, and the public on foreign policy issues. We study how state influences media, how media shapes public opinion, and how public opinion impacts foreign policy in the context of both democracies and authoritarian states. We analyze the role of both traditional and digital media on international issues of conflict, trade, terrorism, immigration, and environmental degradation. We also pay attention to recent trends of anti-foreign nationalism and social media."
POSC325,Capitalism and Its Critics,"This course examines the concept of  capitalism  and introduces students to the debates that began in the eighteenth century and continue into the twenty-first century, over the nature and merits of commercial society and of alternative economic systems. It considers definitional questions in an attempt to understand what capitalism is, but it also explores historical, sociological and political theories of the way in which capitalist societies operate and considers critiques and defences of capitalism as a mode of production or a form of life."
POSC401,Senior Thesis in Political Issue,"The Senior Thesis in Political Science is an intensive course designed for BSocSc students who are planning to pursue graduate studies. Students will conduct an original theoretical or empirical research study under the supervision of a Political Science faculty. Eligible students should first approach a relevant faculty and secure his or her agreement to supervise the thesis before applying for the course. The student will be actively involved in all stages of the research study including but not limited to the formulation of a research question, reviewing the literature, and writing up of the final thesis report. In the case of empirical research, this will also include design of empirical study, development of measurement and procedures, data collection, data analysis. In the case of theoretical research, the literature review should lead to an integration of different theoretical perspectives and/or the proposal of a new theory. The thesis will be done over two consecutive terms in one academic year. Students will submit their final thesis report two weeks before the oral defense of the thesis to the supervisor and appointed co-examiner. The oral defense will typically be held on Week 14 of the second term."
PPPM101,Public Sector Management,"The primary objective of this course is to introduce students to the evolution and basic principles of public sector management, the key management issues that confront public agencies, and the innovations that are occurring during a time where taxpayers and policymakers are demanding significant change in the way public sector organizations operate.  Topics include: bureaucratic behavior, core values of public organizations, public budgeting and finance, policy networks, public-private partnerships(PPP), and e-governance."
PPPM102,Ethics and Public Policy,"What policies should we adopt regarding income inequality, healthcare, safety, aging, social security, the environment, future generations? Should we legalize abortion, euthanasia, organ-trading, human genetic engineering? Is capital punishment a good public policy? These questions cannot be properly answered without knowing the ethical implications of specific policies, which in turn requires some understanding of the basic concepts and principles of ethical reasoning. This course is designed to provide students with a theoretical framework for analyzing and assessing the ethical consequences of public policy."
PPPM104,Psychology and Public Policy,"This course applies research and theories from a variety of areas in psychology to address public policy concerns.  Borrowing from the insights of cognitive psychology (particularly judgment and decision making sciences) and social psychology, the course examines how governments can implement policies to achieve the best results.  Other topics include the cost of psychopathology to society and the effect of policies such as progressive taxation on the individual and collective psyche."
PPPM105,New Thinking in Governance,"Governance and public policy contend with a world that is increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA). Traditional approaches to policymaking continue to be relevant and necessary in some cases, but are also insufficient and need to be complemented by new ways of thinking. This course examines the key paradigms in policy work, particularly the role(s) played by government (the state) and the market, and then explores how new and complementary roles for communities, business and other sectors have developed in recent policy cases."
PPPM106,Policy Design and Analysis,"This course critically analyses public policy designs and how governments pursue the process of designing. With an overarching focus on contemporary environmental sustainability topics, the course allows students to explore questions about how different categories of policy instruments or tools that are part of governments  public policy  toolkits  are formulated, how they work and how they can be combined in order to address multifaceted problems of the environment. The course allows an examination the craft of policy design from a policy process perspective, namely: how public policy problems get framed and raised on government agendas, how different instruments are analysed, combined and chosen as solutions to these problems, how these instruments mixes are implemented and how their success at addressing policy goals gets evaluated. Students of the course will have the opportunity to analyse contemporary environmental policy cases and learn about the policy design experience from experts of the field who will be invited as guest speakers to the classroom.  Some topics that are covered in the course include: policy cycles; policy tool classifications; simple vs. complex tool mixes; policy instrument calibrations; procedural instruments; nudges and nodality tools; regulations and authority-based instruments; organizational tools and tools for co-production and collaborative government."
PPPM108,From Numbers to Narratives: Evidence in Modern Policy-making,"In today's fast-paced and interconnected world, policy challenges are multifaceted and often transcend traditional boundaries. Governments worldwide are tasked with navigating this complexity, requiring an evolved approach to policy-making and the incorporation of diverse forms of evidence. This course adopts an interdisciplinary, practitioner-focused perspective, exploring the diverse landscape of evidence and its role in innovative policy-making.

Through an examination of case studies from various policy areas and different countries, we delve into how governments and public organizations use
multiple types of evidence, from traditional statistical data to intuition and experiential insights, to formulate impactful policies. Our exploration
encompasses both technical tools like Python and Tableau, as well as thought frameworks like scenario thinking and futures thinking, providing a holistic
view of the evidence-policy nexus. We will investigate the role of different stakeholders in the policy-making process, emphasizing the concept of co-creation within the Singapore context."
PPPM201,Environmental Policy,"This course introduces students to environmental  policies at the local, national, and supranational level. The course analyses alternative views concerning problems of climate change with specific attention paid to social, political, and economic issues and discourses pertaining to energy, air and water pollution, food waste and plastics, biodiversity and deforestation. The course also addresses major controversies regarding values, institutions, public opinion, and education, the role of business and society, environmental risk, competing approaches to regulation, environmental justice, sovereignty, and non-traditional security issues."
PPPM203,Education Policy - A Global Perspective,"This course focuses on issues related to developing and improving the quality of education systems around the world.  This topic is of fundamental relevance to international development, worldwide peace, eliminating global poverty, and improving the well-being of all people around the world.  The course deals with issues of particular relevance for explaining the quantity and quality of formal schooling across developing and industrialized nations.  These issues include compulsory education, child labor, public and private schooling and the intersection of education with capitalism, democracy, and nationalism. 

We will also look at the debates on educational curriculum and pedagogy and how they relate to culture and values.  We explore the burning problems of educational inequality across gender, race, and socio-economic classes and discuss the role of international organizations (IOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in supporting education.  The course material focuses on a variety of case studies from Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  In addition to examining the situation of education in developing countries we will also seek to draw some lessons from the experiences of Europe, North America, and East Asia to see how they developed their education systems and to understand which practices seem to work better than others in particular contexts."
PPPM204,Political Participation and Policy,"Why do people choose to participate in politics and the policy process? What effect does citizen input have on policymaking? This course explores these questions by examining the relationship between political participation and policy. We will examine both familiar forms of participation such as voting and collective action, as well as newer institutions designed to increase citizen participation in the policy process, including participatory budgeting and community-led development. The course considers how institutions and individual attributes shape citizen participation and its influence over the policy process. Throughout the course, we will draw connections between academic literature and real-world policy issues in Southeast Asia and around the world."
PPPM205,Religion and Policy in Asia,"Religion is not often analysed in conjunction with public policy. Policy involves the architecture of regulation   evoking rationality and secular bureaucracy. Religion, on the other hand, is rooted in ideology and ritual, and faith in things unseen. However, religion underpins not only most societies and cultures of Asia, but is also a key element in nation-state formation and identity. It wields formidable political clout. Furthermore, policy-making on religious matters is one of the most sensitive and contested areas of governance in contemporary Asia. In this course we will explore the rise and fall of the secularization thesis and the apparent rise of religiosity as a political force. We will closely examine and complicate the relationship between religion and the state, and we will explore ways in which religion impacts policy-making in seemingly  secular  areas such as health-care, trade, and citizenship. We will examine the role of the state in managing religious diversity and multi-culturalism, touching also on its role in enforcing religious orthodoxy. Throughout this course we will seek to develop a nuanced and grounded understanding of the interplay between religion and policy in Asia."
PPPM206,Public Policy and Public Management Work-Study Elective,"The work-study elective is a collaboration between SMU and industry partners across various sectors to provide students with real-world insights into the complexities of policy analysis, formulation, and implementation, as well as effective public sector management practices. Students will undertake a 6-month extended internship programme in a partner organization between January to June each year. The programme will allow students to engage in collaborative and substantial work projects while pursuing academic training on relevant frameworks and topics. By the end of the programme, students will be equipped with the knowledge and practical skills to engage with diverse stakeholders and foster collaboration and effective policy outcomes."
PPPM301,Public Policy Task Force,"Public Policy Task Force (PPTF) is a core part of PPPM program. PPTF emphasize the development of problem-solving and analytical skills that constitutes a strong comparative advantage for PPPM students. Students are required to sign up for a specific public policy topic that is suggested by a faculty, discuss, and deliberate core theoretical issues for a few weeks, and then conduct actual field works for solving policy problems. At the end of semester, students are required to come up with a specific policy recommendations and reports. The topics include: subjective well-being, environmental pollution, climate change, international conflicts, immigration policy, urban transportation, poverty, etc."
PSYC001,Introduction to Psychology,"Psychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental processes. The goals of this science are to measure and describe behavior, understand and explain it, and predict and modify it. This course will introduce students to the study of behavior as a scientific enterprise and as a formal academic discipline. Topics include the biological bases of behavior, motivation, learning, sensation, perception, memory, thought and knowledge, language, social behavior, intelligence, personality, development, and psychopathology. The overall goal is to provide students with an overview of contemporary Psychology."
PSYC102,Abnormal Psychology,"This course introduces the major concepts and approaches to explain a variety of psychological disorders and abnormal behaviors.  It will cover topics such as anxiety and stress-related disorders, personality disorders, mood disorders, cognitive disorders, eating disorders, addictive behaviors, sexual problems, and suicide.  Various therapeutic methods and intervention programs will be discussed.  Emphasis will be given to applications to mental health in the workplace including illustrations and explanations in the context of Singapore."
PSYC103,Cognitive Psychology,"This course introduces students to the cognitive basis of behaviors and provides a framework of how human beings perceive, retain, and process information. It will cover topics such as attention, pattern recognition, concept formation, memory, language, reasoning, problem solving, and judgment and decision making."
PSYC104,Developmental Psychology,"This course provides an overview of the psychological research on developmental processes throughout the lifespan.  It will include developmental processes in the prenatal period, infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood in the areas of cognition and reasoning ability, morality, emotions, social behavior, and personality."
PSYC105,Industrial and Organisational Psychology,"This course provides an overview of theories, research findings, and applications in the field of Industrial and Organizational (I-O) Psychology.  The course will cover conceptual and measurement issues relating to job performance and individual differences, fundamentals of personnel selection and training processes, and research findings on critical phenomena at work including motivation, satisfaction, commitment, and justice and fairness perceptions."
PSYC106,Physiological Psychology,"This course provides an overview of the relationships linking physiology and psychology, with an emphasis on the psychological principles and approaches to the neural and biological bases/correlates of human behavior.  The focus will be on the empirical research linking physiological findings to psychological functions such as learning, perception, memory, emotion, and complex goal-directed behaviors."
PSYC107,Psychology of Individual Differences,"This course provides an overview of the psychological research on individual differences in the normal population, with an emphasis on the theories, measurement, and applications of various individual difference constructs.  It will include topics such as intelligence and related cognitive abilities, problem-solving and thinking styles, personality traits, motivations, and values."
PSYC108,Social Psychology,"This course gives an overview of the field which studies the behavior, thoughts and feelings of individuals in social contexts. The course will cover topics such as social cognition, social perception, social motivation, attitude formation and change, interpersonal dynamics, aggression and altruism, social influence and leadership, conformity, and antisocial behavior."
PSYC109,Psychology of Group Processes and Decision Making,"This course is designed to provide a foundation in scientific literature for understanding groups and inter-group processes from an organizational psychological perspective. The current course will be especially concerned with behaviors in groups or teams with specific tasks to perform, like solving a problem, reaching a decision, or resolving a conflict. Examples of key topic areas include social loafing, polarization, groupthink, information sharing, inter-group conflicts, and crowd. This course encourages students to identify and solve practical problems related to work groups and teams in organizations. Throughout the semester, we want to ask the question of how to communicate and present our knowledge to influence policies and practices for effective team process utilization in the real world."
PSYC110,Psychology Research Methods I,"Psychology experiments can range from simple to complex, but there are some basic terms and concepts that all students of psychology should understand. This course introduces students to the core methodological concepts and procedures used in empirical research in psychology.  Basic issues relating to the formulation of research questions, hypothesis generation and testing, research design, measurement, descriptive and inferential statistics, and ethical principles will be discussed.  Applications in various areas of psychology will be used to illustrate these issues."
PSYC111,Subjective Well-Being,"Subjective well-being (SWB) refers to individuals  evaluations and experiences of the quality of their lives in terms of how they think and feel, so it involves both cognitions and emotions. At the general level, we can construe SWB as the relative presence of positives and absence of negatives. However, what are these positives and negatives, how do they combine and inter-relate, and why and how do they matter? The psychological study of subjective well-being attempts to address these questions using an evidence-based approach grounded in the scientific method and the empirical research on the constructs, causes, correlates, and consequences of SWB. The goal of this course is to introduce students to the scientific literature and psychological study of SWB. Although the primary focus is on SWB at the individual level due to the inherently subjective nature of the construct, we will also discuss issues and implications in the contexts and levels beyond the individual such as the team, organizational or national levels."
PSYC112,Health Psychology,"This course is designed to provide students with a foundation in the scientific literature and key concepts related to health psychology. In particular the course will examine health-related behaviors and evaluate interventions aimed at modifying or promoting these behaviours. Topics will include health and wellness promotion, stress, coping and resilience and psychological issues with managing chronic and terminal illnesses. This course requires active learning and engagement."
PSYC201,Psychometrics and Psychological Testing,"This course covers the measurement principles and data analysis techniques associated with the development, validation, and use of psychological tests such as cognitive ability tests, personality tests, and measures of attitudes and values.  Examples of topics that may be covered include conceptual bases of test construction, reliability assessments, test validation strategies, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, structural equation modeling, psychometric test bias and social fairness, implementing psychometric measures and assessing practical outcomes, and professional and ethical issues in psychological testing."
PSYC202,Cultural Psychology,"Human thought and behavior do not exist in a cultural vacuum.  This course provides an overview of the psychological research on how culture affects the way humans think and behave.  Examples of topics that may be covered include cognition, motivation, personality, self concept, inter-personal processes, and inter-group processes.  Methodological and data analysis issues that are particularly important in cultural psychology such as measurement invariance and emic versus etic approaches may also be discussed."
PSYC203,Social Cognition,"The social cognition movement has emerged as the dominant paradigm in social psychology since the 1980s.  This course examines the role that cognitive processes play in social psychological phenomena, including impression formation about individuals, group stereotyping, attributional thinking, self knowledge, motivation, and judgment and decision making.  One of the primary goals of the social cognition orientation is to better understand the psychological processes that underlie many of the forces that shape, and are shaped by, social interaction.  This course will cover traditional topics in social psychology (e.g., person perception) as well as less traditional ones (e.g., the role of unconscious thought in social interaction)."
PSYC204,Psychology of Reasoning and Thinking,"People often have to make choices under situations involving uncertainty and risk. To understand how people make choices or decisions, we need to understand the thinking, reasoning and judgment processes involved. In addition, decision and choice situations often involve making tradeoffs (e.g. price versus quality) or evaluating multiple different options and alternatives. With limited human cognitive capacity and the multiple task demands involved in choice and decision making, it appears that reasoning or decision-making processes are challenging. This course will help you understand these complexities and processes. It will cover topics such as judgments of risk and uncertainty, affect and decision making, self-control, heuristics and biases. In addition, we will connect decision-making theories to other areas of application, such as negotiation, consumer behaviour, and team processes."

PSYC212,Psychology of Sustainability,"Today s pressing sustainability issues, such as climate change, pollution, and loss of biodiversity, are largely anthropogenic. Addressing these problems, therefore, requires an understanding of human psychology and behaviour. In this course, we use psychological theories and empirical findings to understand thoughts, feelings, and behaviours regarding environmental problems. We cover various individual, social, and cultural factors and levels of processes to find the psychological roots of various environmental problems as well as solutions to address these problems. Specific topics include risk perceptions, values, group identity, and social norms."
PSYC213,"Work, Play, and Life","Modern societies extol busyness and may even regard work as a defining aspect of one's life. Consequently, leisure is often relegated as ""time off work"" and sometimes leads people to construe work and leisure as opposites. This promotes the pursuit of passive and convenient leisure in contrast to their more goal-directed and effortful work activities. Unfortunately, research shows that passive leisure is not restorative nor provides important ingredients to meaningful living. In this course, we examine people s motivation to work and its reciprocal relationship with their pursuit of leisure. It aims to help students apply to their daily lives what the psychological literature advocates about quality leisure activities and living a ""good"" life, which will also help them flourish at work."

Gross market value in mid-2019 was about $12 trillion. This compares with about $80 trillion of stock value worldwide.

Global businesses are exposed to movements in exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, and equity prices. Derivatives and structures combining different asset classes are popular for corporate buyers and UHNW individual investors. They offer strategic value to clients with specific needs and abilities to undertake specific risks. A structured product specialist can come up with new ideas to structure market instruments in a way that helps clients hedge at the lowest costs and at the risk exposures the clients are comfortable with. The structured product specialist also needs to sell the idea and complex instrument to clients and advise them on adjustments in the positions should there be foreseeable adverse market changes. At the same time, the product specialist needs to understand the risk exposures on the sell-side positions and work with front office teams to hedge and trade those positions.

This course is designed to equip students with knowledge of market asset classes such as equities, fixed income, commodities, foreign exchange, and credit. Basic theoretical and practical aspects of derivatives and structuring will also be covered. This course provides more than just an introduction to bonds, futures, and options.

QF609,Risk Analysis,"This module concentrates on approaches to measuring and controlling market risk and credit risk, and also touches on the regulatory framework and the reasons behind the increase of importance of this discipline over the last 10 years.

The students will learn to analyse and quantify risk according to current best practice in the markets, including the RiskMetrics and CreditMetrics methodologies.

The module looks at risk analysis both from a mathematical and an empirical point of view as well as from the viewpoint of practitioners."
QF620,Stochastic Modelling in Finance,"Since the seminal work of Fisher Black, Myron Scholes and Robert Merton in the early seventies, an elegant theory has been developed for efficient derivatives securities valuation. The concepts of arbitrage, martingales and numerical methods are the three pillars on which the theory and implementation of the valuation of derivative securities rests. Today, advanced financial modelling techniques, developed by collaboration between academics and practitioners, have fundamentally transformed the financial market landscape. The derivatives business alone is a multi-trillion-dollar market. The objective of this course is to provide students a first course in financial calculus and the modelling of financial derivatives.

Although the main emphasis of this course is on models based on stochastic processes, we start with binomial trees to illustrate 3 key concepts: hedging, no-arbitrage, and risk-neutrality. This lays down the foundation for more advanced topics, including martingales, stochastic integrals, stochastic differential equations, Ito s formula, change of measure etc. The insight that created this subject and led to the development of the field of financial derivatives is the pricing and hedging of vanilla European options. There are two main approaches   1) stochastic calculus with partial differential equation and 2) probability theory with martingale pricing formula. Both will be covered in this course. The same framework has subsequently been applied to the pricing and hedging of other more exotic financial products. Regardless of the approach taken, the theory is based on the assumption on no-arbitrage, and hence strong emphasis is placed on the importance of hedging and dynamic replication.

This course is an interesting mix of finance and mathematics. Students will see that simple financial concepts like the no-arbitrage principle, coupled with careful mathematical reasoning, can lead to a sophisticated formulation of pricing and hedging framework. Students are encouraged to form a rigorous understanding of financial modelling, valuation techniques and hedging."
QF621,Quantitative Trading Strategies,"The increasing prevalence and accessibility of cheap computing power is revolutionizing the way hedge funds and investment banks trade and operate in the financial market. Quantitative trading strategies rely on the use of efficient and intuitive mathematical models to provide short-term forecast or to identify mispricing and arbitrage opportunities in the market. Once a strategy has been conceived, rigorous back-testing against historical market data is performed. Strategies are judged and eliminated by their profitability and feasibility. Once a quantitative strategy has passed the due diligence checks, it will be implemented as a computer algorithm and run real-time in an automated manner.

This course offers an introduction and a broad overview of the development of quantitative trading strategies over the years. It then moves on to cover a spectrum of successful and useful quantitative strategies, all of which are still being employed in the market today. The course is targeted at practitioners intending to apply these techniques in the market   all mathematical and theoretical formulations are followed by practical examples of how they are being implemented in the industry, or a case study based on real market data."
QF622,Credit Risk Models,"After the global financial crisis and bank failures, it has come to be widely recognized that credit risk is a critical component of all OTC trades, instead of credit derivatives alone. This course offers a mathematical survey of the latest developments in the world of credit risk modeling. The course starts with a compact overview of probability theory and its application to credit risk modeling, including the structural approach via Merton's model, intensity-based approach, and other common approaches. It then moves on to model the credit risk of defaultable bonds and pure vanilla swaps, which are often a significant part of a bank or financial institution's risk exposure and necessitates risk management and regulatory capital charge computations.

In addition to mathematical modeling of credit risks, this course also offers an industry-centric view of firmwide credit risk modeling and management, with focuses on collateralization and value adjustment methodologies, covering topics on discount curve construction, central clearing, Credit Support Annex (CSA), credit value adjustment (CVA), funding value adjustment (FVA), liquidity value adjustment (LVA) and debt value adjustment (DVA) alike. Importance of identifying and quantifying Wrong Way Risk (WWR) and Right Way Risk are also detailed. The course will be given from a practitioner s perspective, where multiple scenario analysis and examples will be given for all of the concepts introduced."
QF623,Portfolio Management,"The aim of this module is to introduce students to the asset management industry with an emphasis on common risk premia strategies and portfolio construction methods. Given the focus on the MSc program, the course will be taught with a quantitative bent. However, the overarching aim is to equip students with the key tools and a broad awareness of the key issues in the industry. It is targeted at students with a keen interest to join the asset management industry as a quantitative analyst or portfolio manager. The course will first look at the theoretical aspects of modern portfolio theory.

The datasets finance researchers have at our disposal was unimaginable even only a few years ago: satellite images, credit card transactions, sensor data, web scrapes, sentiment from news and tweets, geolocation of cargos crossing the oceans, and the like. The size of financial data has experienced exponential growth. With computational resources becoming cheaper, these data can be analyzed in full to hunt for hidden patterns or relationships previously undetectable. In recent years, there is a growing need for data specialist with a strong background in financial and quantitative modelling to accelerate digital transformation in both the Singapore and global financial markets.

Unlike most other big datasets, financial data is widely known to be extremely noisy with a weak signal-to-noise ratio. Many patterns uncovered are due purely to randomness. With the availability of advanced machine learning algorithms, financial data scientists with a deep knowledge of financial data properties are in demand. There is a surge of interest in exploring the application of machine learning to financial problem. For example, in 2019 JP Morgan assessed the feasibility of using AI for option pricing, while Hull (2020) explored using reinforcement learning to self-discover the dynamic delta hedging strategy for option pricing.

SOCG001,Understanding Societies,"The interdependence between society and the individual is the primary focus of sociology and social anthropology. In order to understand society one needs to develop sociological imagination a quality of mind that provides an understanding of ourselves within the context of the larger society (C. Wright Mills). This course serves as a foundation for understanding society, culture, individuals and their relationships. The course will familiarise students with various sociological concepts, theories and methodologies to explore social organisations, institutions, and stratifications. The objective of the course is to understand the ways in which societies can be analysed systematically as well as critically observe how individuals, institutions, culture, symbols, and social structure interact to shape society and human behavior."
SOCG111,Media and Society,"Living in a media inundated society, we are constantly bombarded with messages from the omnipresent mass media including newspapers, magazines, radio, television, movies, and, increasingly, the Internet and social media. These messages not only sell products but promote ideas, values, a sense of right and wrong, and what is and is not important in life. By constructing, disseminating, and contesting such messages, the mass media have significantly changed the face of   sometimes even given rise to   various social phenomena and processes, from celebrity culture to devastating wars, from children s socialization to political reforms, from international relations to social movements, to name just a few. This course examines many themes around the mass media, including the ways the media construct and share meanings, the ways audiences approach and digest media content, media as tools of power that benefit some societal members while disadvantage others, and the role of media in identity work, community building, and social change."
SOCG201,Social Stratification and Inequality,"Social stratification concerns the unequal distribution of things that are scarce but widely desired to different positions in society and the process of placing individuals into these positions. Stratification is the core of both societies and sociology.

The emergence of global economy, the heightening of global inequalities, the decline of nation states, the globalization of consumption culture, etc. will be discussed.  Along with an emerging global society, we are seeing an equally important social trend - the emergence of information society.  Information and ICTs have become more and more as a determinant factor for future social change.  The course will discuss topics on the nature of an information society, how ICTs reshape our social and political life, the creation of virtual communities, googlization, and digital inequality.  At the end, we discuss how these two trends interact with each other in transforming our society."
SOCG211,"Food, Environment and Sustainability","This course explores the connections between food, environment and sustainability. We use empirical materials from food-related issues agricultural production, food manufacturing and processing, food distribution and retail, food consumption, and global food trade to learn about theories in environmental sociology and political ecology, and discuss the possibility of sustainable food systems and agriculture and debate the future environmental sustainability.
The first part of the course is devoted to introducing students to key theoretical perspectives in environmental sociology. Environmental sociology examines the changing relationship between social systems and the environment and explores how environmental issues emerge and can be addressed as social problems. In the second part, we take these theoretical perspectives to investigate the food system. We explore how society and environment interacts throughout the food system, how the current food system faces challenges in sustainability, and how sustainable alternatives can be developed."
SOCG212,Population and Society,"This course will cover demographic theories of population growth and composition; population processes and their impact on society; the emergence of, and changes to, institutions that deal with population problems (e.g., social security, pension systems); and the basic methods demographers use to track changes in mortality, fertility, and migration. Classical and contemporary demographic debates and theories will be discussed. By the end of the course, students should be able to substantively engage anyone in a discussion of past, present, and future population problems that affect different societies."
SOCG213,Sociology of Fads and Fashion,"From bell bottoms to IPhones, yoyos to tech stocks, what is in-fashion or popular at one point of time can be easily displaced by a new trend. Sociologists have long grappled with the understanding of fashions and tastes as problems of cultural change and social stability. This course reviews classical and contemporary sociological writings and explores this literature with two guiding questions:

  What drives fashion to change and fads to occur? 
  How can research on fashion and fad be usefully applied in the real world, from high-fashion to policy making, from marketing to economic planning?
The major topics explored include thresholds and tipping points, contagiousness and social diseases, information cascades, social class and the origins of taste, self-fulfilling prophesies, and theories of social networks. The course draws on a diverse range of case studies, including racial segregation, riots, high-fashion, economic bubbles, music preference and the diffusion of civil protest.

Students are advised to complete SOCG001 Understanding Societies before enrolling for this course."
SOCG214,Bureaucracy and Complex Organization,"Our modern world is powerfully shaped by the actions of large scale complex organization.  This course introduces to students the sociological analysis of large-scale bureaucratic organizations, with a focus on the characteristics of bureaucracy, organizational behaviors, power relations in organizations, organizational change, and both the positive and negative impact of formal organizations on society and upon the individuals within them."
SOCG215,Introduction to Sociological Theory,"This course examines the major theoretical developments in sociological theory from the classical period of Marx, Weber, and Durkheim to contemporary schools from structural-functionalism, conflict theory, exchange theory, and symbolic interactionism. The purpose of this course is to introduce the students to a variety of theoretical orientations, past and present, with an emphasis on the strengths and weaknesses of each theoretical approaches. Students are expected to develop skills to analyse social issues critically by learning these theories and to be able to use them as analytical tools for sociological research."

SOCG218,Social Problems in Asia,"This course is designed to investigate various social problems in Asia through a sociological lens.  Social problem is defined as a condition or pattern of behavior that is considered to be harmful to society or its members.  A diverse sample of social problems, including crime, drugs and alcohol, poverty, gender inequalities, prostitution, divorce and low birth rates, ageing, and environmental issues will be examined.  These issues will be analyzed in a country specific context.  The Asian countries that will be covered include China, Japan, South Korea, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, etc.  Through intensive readings and class discussion, this course seeks to develop an analytical framework that can be used to understand the causes and effects of social problems, and to develop possible remedies or policies in addressing these issues."
SOCG220,Sociology of Terrorism and Political Violence,"Have you ever watched news coverage of a major act of political violence and wondered to yourself   what would lead people to do this?  Is  terrorist  just a political label   one person s terrorist is another person s freedom fighter? Does terrorism actually work? Why do terrorists deliberately target innocent civilians? How does coping with the threat of terrorism change a society? In this class you will learn some of the latest social science research, concepts, and  theories that are used to answer these and other questions on a topic that sometimes generates more heat than light. Our goal is to go beyond pop-culture explanations and politicized rhetoric and try to understand, on a much deeper level, why human beings resort to terrorism as well as other forms of political violence."
SOCG221,Sociological Theories of Crime and Deviance,Crime and deviance are universal features of all societies. They are often exciting and popular areas of investigation for sociology and sociologists. What constitutes crime and deviance however varies across cultures and through time. Their changeability suggests that crime and deviance are socially constructed categories. Who defines acts of crime and deviance in a particular society? Why do certain acts become deviant or criminalised in a particular society at a particular point in time? How can the cross-culturally relative notions of crime and deviance be sociologically accounted for? What are the tools necessary to disseminate who and what are to be considered deviant or normal and to impose these definitions upon society at large?
SOCG222,Nation-Building in Asia,"Even in this age of globalization, we continue to live in the world of nation-states, and nationalism is ready to flare up whenever disputes break out over territories, natural resources, and historical injustices. But why do people come to feel so strongly about their national identities that they do not hesitate to denounce and even demonize foreigners? This question has important implications for Asia, where many nation-states are relatively young and forced to negotiate the competing demands for nation-building and regional integration. This course thus takes a sociological look at how national identity is socially constructed within the larger context of economic development, cultural practices, and domestic and international politics."
SOCG223,Sociology of Education,"The education system is one of the most important institutions in the contemporary world. It plays a decisive role in socializing younger generations, stratifying them to different socioeconomic statuses, and producing new visions, knowledge, and technologies for society. Given its connections with the economy, politics, family, and other spheres of social life, however, the education system is also penetrated by multiple societal problems and contradictions. In this course, we will examine these problems and contradictions, simultaneously internal and external to the education system, while critically reflecting on our own experiences as stakeholders in the system."
SOCG224,Sociology of Work,"Working, particularly in the form of paid employment, is important to our sense of self, dignity, and our morality. Yet in the 21st century decent work is hard to come by and insecure work prevails. Alongside unemployment and underemployment, insecure employment such as contract work, and internships have become de rigueur, including for groups of people   such as highly educated workers   who used to be exempt from the vagaries of the labor market. This course will examine trends that have shifted work away from a cradle-to-grave, steady work which predominated in the 20th century. We will also study how experiences of unemployment, underemployment, and other non-standard work impacts people in their everyday lives. This class will center on questions such as: what does work look like now, for people across social classes?; what does the absence of steady work mean for personal relationships?; how does this insecurity impact their aspirations for themselves or for their children? We will draw on recent social science research on contemporary experiences of work the world over."
SOCG225,International Migration,"Why do people move and what does this mean to the places they travel to and from? This course explores the theories and debates that have shaped how we understand migration (including international migration) and the role of cities in contemporary global movement. The course is organized around crucial topics that have emerged in theory, empirical and applied research. While the focus is on migration and urbanization, the course also explores how other social issues surrounding gender, ethnicity, family, and identity also affect our understanding of mobility today."
SOCG226,Medical Sociology,"Medical Sociology (also commonly known as the Sociology of Health and Illness) is one of the most important contributions sociology makes to understanding critical social issues prevalent in our society. In this course, we will focus on the social construction of well-being and illness, and the influence of the social on health policies.  We will also look through sociological lens at the dynamics in health-seeking behavior, the doctor-patient relationship, the professionalization of medicine in general as well as the role of alternative healing systems in a society where the western biomedical module predominates."
SOCG227,InterAsian Mobilities,"This course will explore the migrations and cross-border mobilities that occur from and within Asia. While social science research has seen a broadening interest in how nations are interconnected in today's globalized world, much of the field continues to be focused on movements towards destinations in the West. This course will allow students to critically examine our conventional understanding of global mobility in the context of Asia, where nationhood is ""new"" and migration is ""old."" The class will discuss a wide range of case studies: transnational families, unauthorized migration, ""new"" racisms, and multinational migrations within the region."
SOCG228,Social Entrepreneurship Challenge in the Indo-Pacific,"This course is designed to provide hands-on experience with social entrepreneurship, innovation and design. Students will work with an international group of social enterprises, industry leaders, and mentors as part of a model incubator program. Students will undertake an intensive innovation and design training in the first week, and then undergo the model incubator program with the support of industry mentors and structured workshops to provide insight into social entrepreneurship in different country contexts across the Asia-Pacific, including India, Indonesia and China. Over the course of the three weeks, students will work in interdisciplinary teams made up of students from our partner universities in Australia, Indonesia, and India to come up with, design and pitch an idea to an expert panel. Students will gain insight into the world of entrepreneurship and how it can be used in different contexts as a realistic model to create genuine and sustainable change. They will develop a critical lens to identify and assess opportunities across the Asia-Pacific, and be equipped with the knowledge, tools and networks to continue their studies and engagement across the regions in social entrepreneurship."
SOCG301,Special Topics in Sociology,"Selected topic, vary from year to year, will be taught based on the research expertise of the instructor.  With a much narrow focus on particular topics, this course will give students an opportunity to have a more in-depth understanding of the sociology discipline both theoretically and methodologically."
SOCG303,Capitalism: Past and Present,"This course investigates capitalism as the economic institution that creates our modern world.  With a theoretical critic of this institution as the objective of this course, we will look at both the social-historical origin of capitalism and the embedded social contexts that eventually lead to the development of a variety of capitalisms in our contemporary world."
SOCG304,Social Networks,"Social networks are the subject of some of the most exciting recent advances in the natural and social sciences.  For economists, business executives, IT experts and policy analysts, understanding how social networks operate has become increasingly important for managing the complex interdependent systems they operate within.
