As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication.

This is especially important as good public policy processes place value on social impact, seeks to understand the behavior of Singapore's diverse society, and makes sense and use of increasingly abundant behavioral data. As the Singaporean economy gets more advanced and complex, and citizens get better educated and informed, we rely on decisions strengthened by sound economic thinking. The economist must move towards more rigorous reasoning across the levels of household, corporate, and public choice. In this course we apply fundamental microeconomic principles complemented by behavioral economics to various current everyday concerns in Singapore.

Microeconomics is one of the three core pillars of an Economics major. This is an important module that will serve as a prerequisite for almost all major PE modules. The first part of the course covers the theory of individual decision-making in consumption, risk and labor. The second part of the course covers the theory of firms making production decisions when operating under various market structures, in particular price discrimination with market power and strategic interactions between firms. This course will also expose students to new developments in the field of microeconomics which have now come to assume a central role, in particular behavioral economics.

Students will learn basic theories that can be abstract and simple but yet so relevant and powerful in explaining decision problems in our everyday lives.

In Microeconomics applications, you will learn to perform optimization exercises for various decision makers (consumers, producers, etc.), and perform comparative statics analysis. In Macroeconomics applications, you will learn to use functions to represent the various sectors of the economy and combine calculus with linear algebra techniques to analyze and compare the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies. In the second part of the course you will be introduced to the concept of economic dynamics and the use of differential and difference equations in analyzing the dynamic stability of economic systems.

NTU,Economics and Data Science,HE3125,ECONOMICS OF MENTAL HEALTH & WELL-BEING,"Surveys in many countries conducted over decades show that, on average, people's happiness and life satisfaction have not changed much over the last fifty years, despite large increase in real income per capita for many countries. In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does?  
This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design.
Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings.
Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module. People with a background in the economics of mental health and well-being have found jobs working for the government and NGOs, creating a start-up company that caters directly to improving their clients' well-being, and working in academia.

Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include:

1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains?

2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now.

3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.

Game theory, besides being of fundamental mathematical interest, is a main tool to model economic and strategic situations and then study the behavior of rational agents in such situations. Mechanism design is the study of how to design games (such as auctions) so that agents have incentive to act in a desirable way, e.g. by telling the truth. This course will improve your ability to model and analyze economics situations in a mathematical way. We will study the way rational agents will play games, based on their assumptions about the rationality of other agents. We will learn about the concept of Nash equilibria, which are solutions to games that no rational agent has an incentive to deviate from, and learn how to compute these. 
In the second part of the course we turn to the problem of social choice, namely choosing from a set of alternatives, given the preferences of a set of players. We will see that many desirable properties of social choice functions cannot be satisfied, and then turn to ways to deal with this issue. The first way is to introduce payments and money-valued preferences, which leads to auction theory and related topics. Here students will learn how to design auctions and other economic mechanisms so that players have no incentive to lie, and to learn how to compute expected revenues. Secondly, we will consider mechanisms that do not allow payments, and study the ways manipulations by the players can be limited in this case. In the second part of the course students will learn how to design economic mechanisms that have certain properties (if possible), and how to judge economic mechanisms, as well as to apply Bayesian reasoning to compute expected outcomes.
