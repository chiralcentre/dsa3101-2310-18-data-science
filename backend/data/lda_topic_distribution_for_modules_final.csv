We further study problems which may be formulated using graphs and networks. These optimization problems can be solved by using linear or integer programming approaches. However, due to its graphical structure, it is easier to handle these problems by using network algorithmic approaches. Applications of LP and network optimization will be demonstrated. This course should help the student in developing confidence in solving many similar problems in daily life that require much computing. Major topics: Introduction to LP: solving 2-variable LP via graphical methods. Geometry of LP: polyhedron, extreme points, existence of optimal solution at extreme point. Development of simplex method: basic solution, reduced costs and optimality condition, iterative steps in a simplex method, 2-phase method and Big-M method. Duality: dual LP, duality theory, dual simplex method. Sensitivity Analysis. Network optimization problems: minimal spanning tree problems, shortest path problems, maximal flow problems, minimum cost flow problems, salesman problems and postman problems.","{'or': ['MA1101R:D', 'MA1311:D', 'MA2001:D', 'MA1508E:D', 'MA1513:D', 'MA1522:D']}",Elective,"('Algorithms and Numerical Methods', 'data, course, this, students, will, program, problems, methods, learn, science', [('Project Management', 0.0018030351), ('Algorithms and Numerical Methods', 0.5054622), ('Machine Learning', 0.0018048186), ('Math and Statistics', 0.4909299)])",Algorithms and Numerical Methods,"data, course, this, students, will, program, problems, methods, learn, science","[('Project Management', 0.0018030351), ('Algorithms and Numerical Methods', 0.5054622), ('Machine Learning', 0.0018048186), ('Math and Statistics', 0.4909299)]"

is said to double every nine months. Seeking knowledge from massive data is one of the most
desired attributes of Data Mining. In general, there is a huge gap from the stored data to the
knowledge that could be construed from the data. This transition will not occur automatically, that is
where Data Mining comes into picture. In Exploratory Data Analysis, some initial knowledge is
known about the data, but Data Mining could help in a more in-depth knowledge about the data.
Courses on Database systems give methods to extract information, but they fail to extract
knowledge that is actionable.
Manual data analysis has been around for some time now, but it creates a bottleneck for large data
analysis. Fast developing computer science and engineering techniques and methodology generates
new demands. Data mining techniques are now being applied to all kinds of domains, which are rich
in data. Although data mining is partly based on statistical methods, data mining methods give a lot
more than the statistical methods. Data mining methods are to a large extent based on machine
learning methods. The difference is data mining is meant for huge data whereas machine learning is
usually done over relatively small-sized data. Huge data brings completely a new set of problems to
be solved.

We will explore this course with hands-on examples, illustrating how some data products utilize only a subset of these components, while others deploy the wider gamut. 
This course will also expose techniques to handle various kinds of data on their own and in conjunction, e.g., natural language data, datetime and timeseries, geoseries and graph data; the underlying systems and algorithms to support, analyze and learn using such data to build data products.
Overall, in this course, we will describe several fundamental principles, and we will illustrate them in action using hands-on examples and tools. The choice of algorithms and software packages will be representative but not exhaustive. As such, the detailed description of course content uses 'e.g.,' to give possible indicative instances, but the actual delivery of the course may choose other tools, programming languages, frameworks and examples (including or excluding the indicative instances).

The second part of the course covers the theory of firms making production decisions when operating under various market structures, in particular price discrimination with market power and strategic interactions between firms. This course will also expose students to new developments in the field of microeconomics which have now come to assume a central role, in particular behavioral economics.

Students will learn basic theories that can be abstract and simple but yet so relevant and powerful in explaining decision problems in our everyday lives. On the one hand, it will give students with either no previous economics training a chance to close the gap with those with a stronger background. On the other hand, it will give everyone a chance to appreciate microeconomics in action right from the start of their education at NTU - a feature that is surprisingly amiss in many Economics undergraduate programs worldwide.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does?  
This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design.
Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings.

1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains?

2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now.

3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.

All these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies.","['HE2001 OR', 'HE2002 OR', 'HE9092 OR', 'HE5092']",Elective,"('Project Management', 'will, with, business, this, course, students, market, financial, risk, analytics', [('Project Management', 0.7602901), ('Algorithms and Numerical Methods', 0.0017636643), ('Machine Learning', 0.23617133), ('Math and Statistics', 0.0017748597)])",Project Management,"will, with, business, this, course, students, market, financial, risk, analytics","[('Project Management', 0.7602901), ('Algorithms and Numerical Methods', 0.0017636643), ('Machine Learning', 0.23617133), ('Math and Statistics', 0.0017748597)]"

Game theory, besides being of fundamental mathematical interest, is a main tool to model economic and strategic situations and then study the behavior of rational agents in such situations. Mechanism design is the study of how to design games (such as auctions) so that agents have incentive to act in a desirable way, e.g. by telling the truth. This course will improve your ability to model and analyze economics situations in a mathematical way. We will study the way rational agents will play games, based on their assumptions about the rationality of other agents. We will learn about the concept of Nash equilibria, which are solutions to games that no rational agent has an incentive to deviate from, and learn how to compute these. 
In the second part of the course we turn to the problem of social choice, namely choosing from a set of alternatives, given the preferences of a set of players. We will see that many desirable properties of social choice functions cannot be satisfied, and then turn to ways to deal with this issue. The first way is to introduce payments and money-valued preferences, which leads to auction theory and related topics. Here students will learn how to design auctions and other economic mechanisms so that players have no incentive to lie, and to learn how to compute expected revenues. Secondly, we will consider mechanisms that do not allow payments, and study the ways manipulations by the players can be limited in this case. In the second part of the course students will learn how to design economic mechanisms that have certain properties (if possible), and how to judge economic mechanisms, as well as to apply Bayesian reasoning to compute expected outcomes.

Students will gain knowledge and skills about leadership development and team-building skills based on theories, principles, concepts, application, exercises/class activities, self-assessments/instruments, and experiential learning.

Central to the course is the action-based and experiential Group Project Assignment that offers an opportunity for students to work in groups to collaborate with a non-profit organization or profit-based organization that upholds community development and/or corporate social responsibility or sustainability initiatives1, that is, they initiate and act as idea champions to contribute to community with a project of their own and approach beneficiaries along the way to amend or improve on their ideas. Students are also free to work with any profit and/or non-profit organization on an existing or new project they may have, provided such opportunities exist and are offered to students. 

As idea champions, students work in groups, to develop/invent a prototype/model or mobile application or put into place a process, program or plan such as a business plan that will value-add and contribute to the needs of the beneficiary or organization of their choice. It is entirely up to the leadership of the organization concerned whether they would consider implementing or not implementing what students have designed. In other words, there is no compulsion for any organization to eventually sponsor the proposed ideas to the organization(s) concerned or may be collaborating with.

The outcomes of the group project for students are outlined as follows:
(i) Students will learn about leadership from the leaders they are connecting with. For example, they will learn how and why today s leaders are engaged in community-based or social initiatives in Singapore and beyond.
(ii) Students will also learn from the leaders lessons on leadership and/or teamwork based on the leaders  experiences.
(iii) By undertaking a hands-on group project, students will also learn practical lessons as well as the complexities of teamwork based on their OWN experience and process of working internally, with their group mates and externally, with organizations outside of school.

Science and Technology Studies (STS) is the interdisciplinary study of how science and technology shape society and the environment, and conversely, how society and the environment shape science and technology. Innovation and maturation, systems and regulation, risk and failure are the key notions that exemplify this dynamic relationship. In this course, we will analyze what science is, how it works, and how society provides the means and framework for scientific and technological knowledge. We will draw from various perspectives in the humanities and social sciences, including those of history, anthropology, sociology and public policy to explore different forms of interaction between science, technology, and society. In other words, we will examine the connections between scientific theories and practices, and our social, cultural, economic, and political lives. Specific topics covered include nuclear power and waste, regulation of the internet, data and self-hood, as well as climate change politics. The first unit introduces central ideas in Science and Technology Studies (STS). In unit two, we focus on assumptions and authority of science and technology, asking who benefits from how particular research agendas or new technologies are designed, and who bears the risks of living with uncertain science or dangerous technologies.

Instead of a comprehensive survey, the course will unfold through chronologically arranged topics that include the emergence of industrial society, imperial mobility, urban spectacles, systems of mass production, gendered consumption, digital cultures, risk in the Anthropocene, and technological imaginings. The unifying theme weaving all these topics together will be that far from being deterministic, technology is instead better understood as a site of contestation and negotiation for different visions of society. So that students can dig deeper into those tensions, each week will feature not only scholarly readings, but also two primary source-driven case studies in which groups will explore the complex intersection between technology and society including Singaporean rickshaws, the Magnitogorsk Soviet industrial city, the contraceptive pill, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.

Electronic commerce has become ubiquitous as is digital forms of human interaction and communication. Also, Internet intermediaries have taken on a major role as facilitators of commercial and non-commercial transactions online. These include social networking platforms (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok and Twitter), multimedia sharing platforms (e.g. YouTube, Apple Music, Spotify), search engines and news aggregators (e.g. Yahoo and Google), content hosts and storage facilities (e.g. Dropbox) and many others. Law and policy have to be adapted to deal with the roles and functions of such forms of engagement and the parties involved. Regulators in every jurisdiction are faced with the challenge to manage the new economy and players, and to balance the interest of multiple parties, in the context of areas of law including intellectual property, data protection, cloud technology and cyber-security. The social effects of the development and use of Infocomm technology have to be tackled as well, including privacy, harassment, cyberstalking and access to content.

Students taking this course will be introduced to the legal issues and solutions arising from transactions through the use of digital information, goods and services as well as via non-physical - analog and digital - channels of communication and delivery. The technological developments from Web 1.0 to 2.0 and the future of Web 3.0 with its impact on human interaction and B2B/B2C commerce as well as e-governance will be examined in the context of civil and criminal law. In particular, this course examines the laws specifically arising from and relating to electronic transactions and interaction and their objectives and impact on the individual vis- -vis other parties. Students will be taken through the policy considerations and general Singapore legislations and judicial decisions on the subject with comparisons and reference to foreign legislation where relevant.

459,SMU,Core Curriculum,COR2229,Game Theory for Modern Challenges,"This course uses some of the most pressing global problems to motivate learning of the concepts and methods of game theory. Game theory is the branch of mathematics that deals with strategic interactions: situations where the benefits and costs of each agent or actor depends not just on her actions but also on the actions chosen by other agents. Many problems of global concern, like climate change, the use of artificial intelligence, pandemics, and great power conflicts, are characterized by the tension between self-interest and cooperation, miscommunication, and misalignment of incentives. Game theory is a powerful and incisive tool to analyse these issues because it has been used extensively to address collective-action challenges, which are at the heart of most game-theoretical applications in the social sciences; moreover, solutions to these challenges must account for information manipulation and unintended consequences, which are core game theory concepts.  Collective-action problems are situations where the objectives of the whole society or collective are best served if its members take a particular action or actions; however, as these actions are costly, and one can free-ride on others  actions, individuals are disincentivized from cooperating. To solve these problems, game theory looks at how the strategic interaction among members can be improved to generate cooperation.  This course is designed for non-economics majors who want an accessible but also comprehensive and challenging introduction to the game-theoretic tools and principles essential for understanding the nature and possible solutions to collective-action problems without taking a standard game theory course.

480,SMU,Core Curriculum,COR2619,Fashioning a Nation,"Nations have long sought to evoke loyalty and personal attachment, while in turn providing those living within it with a collective experience and common destiny. The potent force of the nation as a cognitive idea is at the heart of this course, which conceives of the making of a nation as an ongoing work in progress in which everyone has a stake. The central question that we will investigate concerns the reciprocal influences between the nation, its institutional manifestations and  the people . How do  the people  shape institutions and fashion a nation on a daily basis and vice versa?
To explore these relationships, the course is structured around three themes: prerequisites, process and practice. The first theme provides the general conceptual framework through a series of brief discussions of what a nation is, how it relates to a state and to a  people . The second theme is devoted to what is often seen as the quintessential nation-building moment: the formal drafting of a constitution. We will consider the choice of language in that text to harness the people s fidelity to the budding nation as well as the respective roles played by the elites and ordinary citizens during the constitution-process. For the third theme, we will probe the lived reality of how the nation constitutes itself every day through its people, from the elites who claim to speak on behalf of the nation in formal rule-making to the personification of the nation in image, song and icon to the architectural design of state institutions and public spaces and the wearing of folk costumes or traditional outfits that seek to give expression to the identity of the nation.
Our explorations will feature the experiences of a diverse range of nations located within and outside Asia. These will provide the backdrop against which the Singapore story will be considered, thereby allowing students to interrogate the familiar domestic narrative of nation-building from a comparative angle.

This third age of human existence is characterised by retirement from full-time work and a new way of spending time (Carr & Komp, 2011). Through class discussions and group projects, students will dive deeper into disciplines like gerontology, social sciences (intergenerational; social connectedness), public policy (successful ageing), economics (retirement) and technological developments in the ageing space.

We can be fairly certain this was the case well before civilization emerged. Conflicts always seem to erupt over scarce resources, contentious values and ideas, fissures in relationships, fault-lines in societies, the list goes on. And, intertwined with these conflicts are efforts to end violence, to heal wounds and reconcile, to share resources, to create or re-establish a semblance of harmony between peoples. Most of all will perceive these human activities as binary opposites, as mutually exclusive, leading us to invest particular meanings in each to distinguish them further from each other. Indeed, thanks to influences from culture, media, from our communities, families and leaders, we typically perceive war and peace as suffering versus happiness, action not stillness, a zone of masculine combat versus one of safety for women and children, and much more. These ingrained perceptions shape our decisions, actions and relationships in fundamental ways, determining our behaviour and experiences in all spaces and times, whether we have construed them to be in the context of war, peace, and anything beyond or in-between. Since our views of war and peace are so fundamental to our life experience, this course asks us for a deeper engagement of our prior knowledge.

Through critical engagement with a variety of disciplines and empirical contexts, we will consider the intertwined phenomena of war and peace in theory and praxis. The course explores the value systems we attach to each, why, and with what consequences for ourselves and others? We investigate how our notions of war and peace contribute directly to the construction of our identity as well as ideas about belonging, power, justice, progress, and more. In so doing, we look into the ways people, their customs, laws and culture respond to their perceptions and experiences of war and peace; reflect on how they debate the purposes of war-making and peace-making; and discuss how they compete and cooperate for the spoils of both war and peace. Also, we will study how our knowledge of war and peace may continually change over time.

Indeed, Tocqueville believed he  saw in America  an image of the future everywhere, for he believed that equality of conditions from which democratic society grew was the world s inevitable future.  Having reached its most developed form in the United States, equality of conditions modified and transformed all aspects of life, from politics to social relations, to personal relations, to intellectual life, to individual character and values. Given this radical transformation of the world, Tocqueville believed that  A new political science is needed for a world entirely new,  and Democracy in America articulates this new political science.  Tocqueville s masterpiece, then, looks beyond its US context, for Tocqueville hoped to teach his readers what they could hope and fear from democracy, as well as how democratic society might be  educated  to avoid some of the dangers to which it is prone. 

This course takes its inspiration from Tocqueville s ambition, by approaching Democracy in America thematically and using Tocqueville s study as a basis for broader inquiry into features of contemporary democratic society. Each week of the course will focus on a key theme in Democracy in America, and each week will pair that theme with current scholarship applying and extending elements of the Tocquevillian perspective to contemporary contexts.

We begin by interrogating gender in Singapore, asking how dramatists and novelists envision life as a  woman  or a  man  here. We then circle outwards across Indonesia, India and Iran, tracing how letters, novels, films and graphic novels have been used to create and challenge gender norms from the colonial 19th century to the postcolonial 21st. Next, we look at ethnicity, debating its relative mutability, and querying the importance of physical markers of  racial  difference relative to evolving national borders and spiritual and societal practices. We trace how Singaporean and Malaysian writers construct ethnicity in their prose fiction, before considering how authors further afield in East Asia (Japan and China) and West Asia (Turkey and Afghanistan) have re-interpreted communal identities over time. We conclude by considering the future of ethnic and gender identities in Asia.

The desire to accumulate resources is found across civilisations. Yet, should wealth simply measured in economic and financial terms? Should poverty be only measured through the same lens? Many cultures promote the virtues of prudence and fortitude, peppered with ideals of justice and equality in its various guises. Wealth and poverty are often seen as diametric. Despite this, several traditions point to the need for thinking through forms of wealth (and poverty) beyond the conventional lens of economics, and to consider the pursuit of wealth of time, happiness, peace, relationships, and other elements that enrich the human experience. It is little wonder that in our contemporary age, several scholars have pointed towards the reprioritisation of wealth accumulation towards one that places happiness, health and other non-monetary goals as the ideal. In this course, we will be exploring substantially several forms of wealth (beyond the conventional), and to consider carefully the causes and strategies to address the challenges related to wealth and poverty in our contemporary world.

Industry boomed, and the pace of life increased, leading to relentless urbanisation and a boost in mobility and communications. Travelling and the notion of taking a holiday were growing in popularity and a  culture of things  primed consumerism as an expression of social status. While the abolition of slavery had begun, nationalism exploded in a Europe where Imperialism brought large parts of Asia and Africa under colonial rule and introduced new interactions, dependencies, and exploitations.

Artists strove to find new ways of encapsulating this complex world through their creations. With the advent of photography and film, and new building and artistic techniques, some of the most exciting changes in art history took place. This period gave us creative universes as diverse as Monet s open-air impressions, Renoir s zest for life, Toulouse Lautrec s underground worlds, and Van Gogh s anguish.

Throughout the 20th century, new sets of media and art forms appeared, and the social structure of the art world consolidated. New construction materials were used, artistic techniques developed, and a multitude of isms (Cubism, Futurism, Expressionism, etc.) challenged previous conventions. Artists supported and even championed the advancement of social causes. They were often at the forefront of protest movements against wars and injustices and denouncing discrimination by race, gender and sexual orientation. Today, contemporary art simultaneously experiences greater accessibility and democratisation. At the same time, it also suffers an increasing level of commodification and continues to evolve as it finds new ways to innovate, inspire, and provoke its audiences.

This course examines crucial works of art from the nineteenth century to the contemporary. It provides students with a roadmap to reflect on them in an open-minded, critical and analytical way. It considers historical, economic and socio-political contexts, and focuses on the integration of art within the broader cultural environment.

Starting from the stakeholder requirements of citizens and planners of innovative cities, the course will introduce students to urban design concepts as well as commercialization, management challenges and implementation issues of the smart city model. There will also be a focus on how good governance and enabling technologies such as sensor networks can facilitate the creation, management and sustainability of  good  cities.

With the help of case studies and resource persons such as industry leaders, innovative city designers, tech experts and business development experts from local and int. companies such as ST Electronics, JTC, Jurong Consultants, Frost & Sullivan, IDA International, Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) etc., students will be familiarized with the opportunities and challenges of the  smart city business  which represents a key element in the value creation and extraction strategy of the Singapore Government and related businesses.",,GE,"('Project Management', 'will, with, business, this, course, students, market, financial, risk, analytics', [('Project Management', 0.6645378), ('Algorithms and Numerical Methods', 0.04624735), ('Machine Learning', 0.2578102), ('Math and Statistics', 0.03140464)])",Project Management,"will, with, business, this, course, students, market, financial, risk, analytics","[('Project Management', 0.6645378), ('Algorithms and Numerical Methods', 0.04624735), ('Machine Learning', 0.2578102), ('Math and Statistics', 0.03140464)]"
514,SMU,Core Curriculum,COR-MGMT2211,"Harnessing Robotics, UAVs, and Digital Innovation for Business","This course is a response to the increasing use of robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and digital technologies in business and society. Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War I when the US army experimented with unmanned aerial torpedos. Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations. Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various functionalities of robotics, UAVs and digital innovations in order to critically assess these technologies and to articulate informed opinions about  the good ,  the bad , and  the future  of these novel technological developments. The course will be taught by a multi-disciplinary team of instructors plus exposure to tech entrepreneurs and digital (corporate) innovation champions.",,GE,"('Project Management', 'will, with, business, this, course, students, market, financial, risk, analytics', [('Project Management', 0.47436118), ('Algorithms and Numerical Methods', 0.104609035), ('Machine Learning', 0.39437187), ('Math and Statistics', 0.026657965)])",Project Management,"will, with, business, this, course, students, market, financial, risk, analytics","[('Project Management', 0.47436118), ('Algorithms and Numerical Methods', 0.104609035), ('Machine Learning', 0.39437187), ('Math and Statistics', 0.026657965)]"

These three challenges (positioned at the interface of both current and future issues) are not only globally relevant but also have significant local implications for Singapore.

Embedded in the experiential SMU-X initiative, the Transformative Leadership course provides students with a unique learning opportunity to develop and implement (socially) innovative solutions to make a positive impact on business and society in close collaboration with reputable partners in business, nonprofits and government. Learners will be paired up with an external SMU-X partner to work on relevant innovative projects with real impact.

The successful completion of such transformative SMU-X projects requires learners diving deep(er) into various disciplines such as social sciences, business, political governance, public policy, demography, technology, etc. It is expected that the chosen practical challenges commissioned by SMU-X partners will  stretch  students, forcing them to step out of their comfort zones and to explore the unknowns in order to make a  real  difference  out there  in both the social and business sectors.

In terms of effective leader development, in particular, transformative leadership, the SMU-X course design will support learners in expanding their individual capacity to be effective in leadership roles and processes. Emphasis will be put on proximal indicators of leader development such as self-views around self-concept, including leader self-awareness, leadership self-efficacy and leader. Through their SMU-X projects, students will appreciate the importance of leadership development so that they can articulate what it takes for teams and their leaders to create strong(er) alignment and high(er) levels of commitment.
