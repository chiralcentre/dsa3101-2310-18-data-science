RWE Supply & Trading Asia-Pacific Pte. Ltd., Singapore

To start as soon as possible, Full time, Permanent

RWE Supply & Trading is a leading Global commodity trading house with a growing presence in Asia-Pacific.

The Asia-Pacific Trading Desk consists of a multitude of different, mainly interlinked trading desks including a Power Complex, Fuel Complex and Steel Complex Desk in Singapore; as well as trading teams situated in China, Japan and Indonesia looking after domestic products in its respective countries.

With our strong foundation in discretionary-driven futures trading, we have started expanding into increasingly quantitative trading strategies and believe this to be a key area of growth for the desk. Over the past two years, we have successfully built and implemented quantitative strategies in offshore iron ore options as well as Australian SRA interconnector markets.

At this point, we are looking to expand our Singapore-based expertise to meet the increasing structuring and valuation requirements of the local trading teams.

Your role:

As part of our global Structuring & Valuation team in Singapore you will work directly with the desk’s trading teams on topics across derivatives pricing, asset modeling, and quantitative analysis. The role will be focused on asset modeling in the Australian power markets and the extension and maintenance of the existing derivatives pricing infrastructure (mainly option models).

In order for you to effectively bridge the gap between our quant- and asset modeling expertise in Europe and the requirements thereof in Asia, it is essential that you can do an extended stay abroad (minimum 1 month) upon joining the team, as well as bring the flexibility to travel.

In terms of the split between the two focus areas: we expect you to spend roughly half of your time on derivatives pricing infrastructure in close collaboration with our options team (Traders + Quant). The other half requires your own initiative to research and implement adequate asset modeling solutions in Australian power markets – supported by our structuring teams in Europe.

Must-have:
Deep understanding on (1) option pricing theory and numerical procedures and (2) fundamental statistics techniques in analyzing historical data.
Strong programming experience (Python preferred), with at least a couple of years of proven track-record developing and implementing models in a trading environment.

Nice-to-have:
Asset modeling experience, ideally in energy markets.
Experience with cloud-based computing environments like Databricks and Dremio. 

Your tasks:
Asset modeling solutions in Australian power markets (storages, PPAs, batteries, etc.).
Managing and extending Python-based derivatives pricing and risk management platform (European/Asian/American vanilla options, spread options, light exotics).
Collaboration with traders on live implementation and maintenance of models.
Effective communication of observations and empirical results to the teams.
Initiative to independently improve existing quantitative approaches, as well as discover new ones.

Your profile:
PhD or Master’s degree in highly quantitative subject such as mathematics, physics, quantitative finance, or similar.
Minimum 3-5 years full-time job experience in quantitative role in a trading environment.
Ability to learn new skills and understand complex issues quickly.
Be open minded and have an “can Do !” mindset
Enthusiastic approach to work, high level of self-motivation with a willingness to instigate and adapt to new and changing processes.
Disciplined and organized approach to work with the ability to work within tight deadlines and under pressure.
Good team player.
Excellent communication skills.
Fluent in English.

Our Offer

Working in our Singapore office provides the best of both worlds: the chance to join a leading European energy company, combined with the fast pace of a smaller start up.

We are a friendly team, with a strong focus on supporting one another to get the job done. We believe in continuous improvement and are always open to new ideas. You will be given responsibility from the get go.

PropertyGuru.com.sg was launched in Singapore in 2007 and since then PropertyGuru Group has made the property journey a transparent one for property seekers in Southeast Asia. In the last 15 years, PropertyGuru has grown into a high-growth PropTech company with a robust portfolio of leading property marketplaces across its core markets; award-winning mobile apps; mortgage marketplace, PropertyGuru Finance; and a host of enterprise solutions now under PropertyGuru For Business, including a high-quality developer sales enablement platform, FastKey, DataSense, ValueNet, Awards, events and publications across Asia. 

Responsibilities:

 You will be working collaboratively to use data to positively inform and influence the business decisions at PropertyGuru. 
 You will use the data to create compelling narratives to help drive action. For example, why do certain property listings get significantly higher page views than their peers? What actions do consumers/users browsing on the property take before they zero in on the right property? These are some of the many questions that get asked of our data analyst team in PropertyGuru. These questions drive our product development decisions and inform and recommend action items for the marketing, advertising campaigns and product development. 
 You will also be taking part to evaluate and report the key business metrics for the businesses. You will spend time understanding the drivers of the metrics to help the stakeholders understand the potential reasons and hypotheses for the changes. Some of these are related to the A/B experiments that are performed on the users and products as part of their development. 
 Since most of these analyses are driving important decisions, you will need to ensure that these analyses are repeatable and accessible to all with appropriate documentation. 

Requirements:

Required

 Minimum 5 years of industry experience in working with large-scale datasets. 
 Analytical and structured thinking (must have). 
 Communication skills: Can explain the data from business perspective, communicate clearly and effectively to cross-functional business partners of varying technical levels. Good data story telling skill and be able to handle stakeholders’ expectations. 
 Result-oriented and get things done mindset. “We push beyond good” and “We own it and deliver it” are our working culture. 
 Have experience with deep dive and advance analytics, for example forecasting model, customers segmentation, customer behaviors analysis.. 
 The data analyst must be willing to work with unclean data. We have a lot of new features per quarter, which means DA must be prepared to work with new, unprocessed data. 
 Knowledge of SQL is a must. You will need to write custom queries to pull data from BigQuery to support your analyses and hypothesis. 
 Build clear and simple dashboards and presentations. We currently use Looker Studio and Looker for reporting and visualizations. 
 Have a good business mindset, love to solve business questions and eager to make impact 
 Love innovations and apply new technology to “create what’s next”

Good to have 
 Experience working with Google Analytics, Google tag manager is a plus.
