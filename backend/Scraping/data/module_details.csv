NTU,Data Science and Artificial Intelligence,CC0001,INQUIRY & COMMUNICATION IN AN INTERDISCIPLINARY WORLD,"Researchers agree that writing is a tool for thinking (Menary, 2007; Klein & Boscolo, 2016; Miller and Jurecic, 2016; Reis, n.d.). As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication.

In many data products, the role of data can be subtle and the overall product may be composed of other modules, which could be more prominent in appearance.
The scope of this course is confined to the exploration of the life-cycle of typical data products that deploy data-science dominantly or exclusively. We will deconstruct individual components across the full stack: ranging from data acquisition, wrangling and storage, testing, validation, and refinement - spanning exploratory analysis, issues of visualization and presentation, and application of machine learning techniques for decision support, anomaly detection and recommendation systems. We will explore this course with hands-on examples, illustrating how some data products utilize only a subset of these components, while others deploy the wider gamut.

This is especially important as good public policy processes place value on social impact, seeks to understand the behavior of Singapore's diverse society, and makes sense and use of increasingly abundant behavioral data. As the Singaporean economy gets more advanced and complex, and citizens get better educated and informed, we rely on decisions strengthened by sound economic thinking. The economist must move towards more rigorous reasoning across the levels of household, corporate, and public choice. In this course we apply fundamental microeconomic principles complemented by behavioral economics to various current everyday concerns in Singapore.

The course aims to deliver a progressive and rigorous introduction to basic concepts and models of microeconomics, applied to current trends local and global. Microeconomics is one of the three core pillars of an Economics major. This is an important module that will serve as a prerequisite for almost all major PE modules.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does?  
This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design.
Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings.
Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

NTU,Economics and Data Science,HE3111,MONETARY ECONOMICS,"The course will start with a simple model of money, the overlapping generations model where money is a store of value. The fundamentals of the demand for fiat money, inflation, the demand deposit, bank runs and the role of central banking are examined. Then, we will study money interaction with other financial assets and the real effects of money on output and national account.","['HE1003 & HE2001 & HE2002 OR', 'HE1004 & HE2001 & HE2002']"
NTU,Economics and Data Science,HE4040,BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS,"The above figure depicts the Moller Franz illusion. The lengths of the three lateral lines above appear to be different, although they are of the same length. The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include:

1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains?

2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now.

3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.

All these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies.","['HE2001 OR', 'HE2002 OR', 'HE9092 OR', 'HE5092']"

NTU,Economics and Data Science,MH4320,COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS,"This course aims to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of game theory and mechanism design. Game theory, besides being of fundamental mathematical interest, is a main tool to model economic and strategic situations and then study the behavior of rational agents in such situations. Mechanism design is the study of how to design games (such as auctions) so that agents have incentive to act in a desirable way, e.g. by telling the truth. This course will improve your ability to model and analyze economics situations in a mathematical way. We will study the way rational agents will play games, based on their assumptions about the rationality of other agents. We will learn about the concept of Nash equilibria, which are solutions to games that no rational agent has an incentive to deviate from, and learn how to compute these. 
In the second part of the course we turn to the problem of social choice, namely choosing from a set of alternatives, given the preferences of a set of players. We will see that many desirable properties of social choice functions cannot be satisfied, and then turn to ways to deal with this issue. The first way is to introduce payments and money-valued preferences, which leads to auction theory and related topics. Here students will learn how to design auctions and other economic mechanisms so that players have no incentive to lie, and to learn how to compute expected revenues. Secondly, we will consider mechanisms that do not allow payments, and study the ways manipulations by the players can be limited in this case. In the second part of the course students will learn how to design economic mechanisms that have certain properties (if possible), and how to judge economic mechanisms, as well as to apply Bayesian reasoning to compute expected outcomes.
The course is aimed at 3rd and 4th year students interested in economics, mathematical modelling, and applied math in general.
